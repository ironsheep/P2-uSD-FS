# SD Card Driver Architecture Decisions

This document captures the architectural decisions for the multi-cog SD card driver. Each decision includes the P2-specific constraints that make it the correct choice. Use this document as a reference when implementing or reviewing the driver.

## Decision 1: Dedicated Worker Cog (Not Lock-Based Sharing)

### The Question
How should multiple cogs safely access the SD card?

### Options Considered
1. **Lock-based sharing**: Any cog acquires lock, does SPI, releases lock
2. **Dedicated worker cog**: One cog owns SPI; others send commands via hub memory

### The P2 Constraint That Decides This

**P2 pins are controlled by per-cog registers.** Each cog has its own private DIR and OUT registers at addresses `$1FA-$1FF`. When Cog 0 executes `PINH(pin)`, it sets bits in Cog 0's DIR/OUT registers. Cog 1's registers are unaffected.

This means:

```
Lock-Based Approach (PROBLEMATIC):
─────────────────────────────────────
Cog 0 acquires lock
  → PINH(cs), PINH(mosi), PINL(sck)     ← Sets Cog 0's DIR/OUT
  → Do SPI transfer
  → PINFLOAT(cs), PINFLOAT(mosi)...     ← MUST tri-state before release!
  → Release lock

Cog 1 acquires lock
  → PINH(cs), PINH(mosi), PINL(sck)     ← Sets Cog 1's DIR/OUT (again!)
  → Do SPI transfer
  → PINFLOAT all pins
  → Release lock
```

**Every operation requires full pin re-initialization.** If any cog forgets to tri-state before releasing the lock, multiple cogs have `DIR=1` on the same pin, causing undefined behavior.

```
Dedicated Cog Approach (CORRECT):
─────────────────────────────────────
Worker Cog (at startup, once):
  → PINH(cs), PINH(mosi), PINL(sck)     ← Done ONCE, never changes

  repeat forever:
    → Wait for command in hub memory
    → Execute (pins already configured)
    → Signal completion

Other cogs:
  → Write command to hub memory
  → Wait for completion
  → Never touch pins
```

### Decision
**Use a dedicated worker cog.** It eliminates per-operation pin overhead and removes the risk of pin conflicts entirely.

---

## Decision 2: Spin2 Worker via COGSPIN (Not Pure PASM2)

### The Question
Should the worker cog be pure PASM2 (started with `COGINIT`) or Spin2 (started with `COGSPIN`)?

### The Analysis

| Factor | Pure PASM2 | Spin2 + Inline PASM2 |
|--------|------------|---------------------|
| SPI bit-bang timing | Native | Inline PASM2 (same) |
| FAT32 logic (cluster chains, directories) | Complex, error-prone | Natural, readable |
| Code space | 496 longs max (cog RAM) | Unlimited (hub) |
| Maintainability | Difficult | Easy |
| SD card latency | ~1-10ms per operation | ~1-10ms per operation |

**The bottleneck is the SD card, not the P2.** SD card operations take milliseconds. Whether the FAT logic runs in 2µs (PASM2) or 20µs (Spin2) is irrelevant when the card takes 5,000µs to respond.

The existing inline PASM2 for SPI bit-banging is kept—that's the only timing-critical code. Everything else (FAT parsing, directory traversal, cluster allocation) benefits from Spin2's readability.

### Decision
**Use Spin2 worker via COGSPIN.** Keep inline PASM2 only for SPI transfers. This matches the P2-FLASH-FileSystem pattern.

---

## Decision 3: DAT Block Singleton Pattern

### The Question
How do we ensure all callers share the same driver instance?

### The Spin2 Memory Model

```spin2
VAR block: Each object INSTANCE gets its own copy
DAT block: SHARED across all instances of the object
```

When multiple `.spin2` files each declare `OBJ fs : "SD_FileSystem"`, they create separate object instances, but they all share the **same DAT block**:

```
Application.spin2                    ┌──────────────────────────┐
  OBJ fs : "SD_FileSystem"  ────────►│   SD_FileSystem DAT      │
                                     │   (one shared copy)      │
DataLogger.spin2                     │                          │
  OBJ fs : "SD_FileSystem"  ────────►│   cog_id = 3             │
                                     │   api_lock = 2           │
SensorManager.spin2                  │   param_block[...]       │
  OBJ fs : "SD_FileSystem"  ────────►│   buf[512]               │
                                     └──────────────────────────┘
```

### The Singleton Guard

```spin2
PUB start(cs, mosi, miso, sck) : result
  ' ─── SINGLETON GUARD ───
  if cog_id <> -1
    return true                 ' Already running - instant success

  ' First caller proceeds to start worker cog...
```

The first `start()` call initializes the worker cog. Subsequent calls see `cog_id <> -1` and return immediately. All callers share the same worker, buffer, and state.

### Decision
**Use DAT block for all shared state.** Initialize `cog_id` to `-1` at declaration. The singleton guard ensures exactly one worker cog regardless of how many objects are instantiated.

---

## Decision 4: Parameter Block + COGATN Signaling

### The Question
How do caller cogs communicate with the worker cog?

### Options Considered
1. **Hub polling**: Caller writes command, polls `cmd == 0` until done
2. **COGATN signaling**: Caller writes command, executes `WAITATN`, worker signals via `COGATN`

### Why COGATN Wins

| Aspect | Hub Polling | COGATN |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Hub bandwidth during wait | Continuous reads | **Zero** |
| Caller cog state | Busy-looping | **Sleeping** |
| Wake latency | Variable (depends on poll rate) | **0 clocks** |
| Power efficiency | Poor | **Good** |

**COGATN is a hardware interrupt mechanism.** The caller cog truly sleeps—no instructions execute, no hub bandwidth consumed—until the worker sends attention.

### The Protocol

```
Caller Cog                              Worker Cog
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Acquire api_lock
2. pb_caller := COGID()
3. pb_param0..3 := parameters
4. pb_cmd := CMD_xxx  ─────────────────► 5. See cmd != 0
5. WAITATN (sleep)                       6. Execute operation
   │                                     7. pb_status := result
   │                                     8. pb_cmd := 0
   │                                     9. COGATN(1 << pb_caller)
   ▼                                         │
6. Wake instantly ◄──────────────────────────┘
7. Read pb_status, pb_data0
8. Release api_lock
```

### Decision
**Use COGATN for completion signaling.** The parameter block lives in hub DAT. Callers sleep efficiently via `WAITATN`. A hardware lock serializes API access.

## Decision 5: Smart Pin SPI Implementation (Revised 2026-01-21)

### The Question
Should we use SmartPins (P_SYNC_TX, P_SYNC_RX, P_TRANSITION) for SPI, or keep the existing bit-bang PASM2?

### Original Analysis (2026-01-17)

We initially evaluated SmartPins and concluded "keep bit-bang" because:
- No multi-event blocking wait (must poll anyway)
- Proven reliability of existing code
- SD card is the bottleneck, not P2 SPI speed

### Revised Decision (2026-01-21)

After establishing baseline benchmarks and completing card characterization, we're now implementing Smart Pins. The key factors that changed our decision:

| Factor | Original Assessment | New Assessment |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Performance headroom** | "Card is bottleneck" | Benchmarks show 60% efficiency - room for improvement |
| **Sysclk independence** | "Both need clkfreq calc" | Smart Pins make speed changes trivial |
| **Baseline established** | None | 1.5 MB/s read, 425 KB/s write measured |
| **Implementation risk** | High | Mitigated by keeping bit-bang fallback |

### Decision: Implement Smart Pin SPI

**Architecture** (from Phase 1 plan):

| Pin | Smart Pin Mode | Purpose |
|-----|----------------|---------|
| SCK | P_TRANSITION | Clock generation with precise frequency control |
| MOSI | P_SYNC_TX | Data output synchronized to SCK |
| MISO | P_SYNC_RX | Data input synchronized to SCK |
| CS | GPIO | Unchanged (manual control) |

**MSB-First Handling**: SD cards use MSB-first, but smart pins are LSB-first. Solution: Use `REV` instruction (single-cycle) before TX and after RX.

**Implementation Plan**: See `DOCs/Plans/PHASE1-SMARTPIN-SPI.md` for detailed implementation.

### Performance Targets

| Metric | Baseline (bit-bang) | Target (Smart Pin + Multi-Block) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| Read 256KB | 1,467 KB/s | 4,000+ KB/s |
| Write 32KB | 425 KB/s | 1,200+ KB/s |
| SPI Clock | ~20 MHz | 25-50 MHz |

### Risk Mitigation

- Keep bit-banged `transfer()` as fallback during development
- Test with all characterized cards (Gigastone, PNY, SanDisk)
- Use conservative timing initially (pre-edge sampling)

---

## Decision 6: Streamer for SPI Bulk Transfers (REVISED 2026-01-23)

### The Question
Can the P2 Streamer (DMA-like engine) improve SD card transfers?

### Previous Assessment (INCORRECT)

We initially concluded "Streamer Not Applicable for SPI" based on the assumption that the streamer only handles parallel transfers. This was wrong.

### Revised Assessment: Streamer IS Applicable

**The P2 streamer CAN operate in serial mode**, handling 1-bit input or output with its internal NCO providing precise timing. Combined with a smart pin clock generator, this creates a **hardware SPI engine** capable of bulk transfers with zero CPU involvement.

**Reference Implementation**: `flash_loader.spin2` by Chip Gracey demonstrates this pattern successfully for SPI flash programming and reading.

### How It Works

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   Streamer + Smart Pin for SPI                    │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                  │
│  Smart Pin (P_TRANSITION mode)                                   │
│    - Generates SPI clock at programmed frequency                 │
│    - wxpin sets period, wypin sets transition count              │
│                                                                  │
│  Streamer (X_1P_1DAC1_WFBYTE or X_RFBYTE_1P_1DAC1)               │
│    - Operates at NCO-controlled rate (setxfrq)                   │
│    - Reads MISO pin bit-by-bit, assembles bytes to hub           │
│    - Or reads hub bytes, outputs to MOSI pin bit-by-bit          │
│                                                                  │
│  Synchronization                                                 │
│    - NCO rate matches SPI bit rate                               │
│    - Small alignment delay positions samples correctly           │
│    - READ: wypin → waitx → xinit (clock before data)             │
│    - WRITE: xinit → wypin (data before clock)                    │
│                                                                  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### NCO Calculation

```spin2
' For smart pin clock with wxpin #N (N sysclks per transition):
' SPI clock = sysclk / (2N)
' Streamer NCO = $4000_0000 / N

' Example at 320 MHz sysclk, 22.9 MHz SPI:
' wxpin #7 → NCO = $4000_0000 / 7 = $0924_9249
```

### Decision (Revised)

**USE the Streamer for sector read/write operations.** This provides:

1. **Zero CPU involvement** during 512-byte transfers
2. **Maximum throughput** - limited only by SPI clock speed
3. **DMA-like operation** - data streams directly to/from hub

**Critical Implementation Notes:**
- For READS: Disable MISO smart pin before streamer capture (avoids interference)
- For READS: Clock starts first, then streamer (wypin → waitx → xinit)
- For WRITES: Streamer starts first, then clock (xinit → wypin)

**Full Details**: See `DOCs/Decisions/STREAMER-SPI-TIMING.md` for complete timing analysis, NCO calculations, and implementation patterns.

## Decision 7: Error Code Design

### The Question
How should errors be reported to callers?

### Convention
```
0           = Success
Negative    = Error (specific code indicates type)
Positive    = Valid data (byte count, handle, etc.)
```

### Error Code Ranges

| Range | Category | Examples |
|-------|----------|----------|
| 0 | Success | `SUCCESS` |
| -1 to -19 | SPI/Communication | `E_TIMEOUT`, `E_CRC_ERROR` |
| -20 to -39 | Card/Mount | `E_NOT_MOUNTED`, `E_NOT_FAT32` |
| -40 to -59 | File Operations | `E_FILE_NOT_FOUND`, `E_END_OF_FILE` |
| -60 to -79 | Resources | `E_DISK_FULL`, `E_NO_HANDLE` |
| -80 to -89 | Seek | `E_SEEK_PAST_END` |

### Thread-Safe Error Storage

Multiple cogs may call the API concurrently. Each cog needs its own error storage:

```spin2
DAT
  last_error    LONG    0[8]    ' One slot per possible cog

PUB error() : code
  return LONG[@last_error][COGID()]

PRI set_error(code) : code
  LONG[@last_error][COGID()] := code
  return code
```

### Decision
**Use negative error codes with per-cog storage.** This matches P2-FLASH-FileSystem and enables safe multi-cog operation.

---

## Decision 8: Timeout Policy (Not Retries)

### The Question
How should the driver handle communication failures?

### The Policy

**Layer 1 (SPI)**: Use timeouts, not retries.
```
If a transfer times out → return error immediately
The caller decides whether to retry
```

**Layer 2 (Card Init)**: Limited retries during initialization only.
```
CMD0 (GO_IDLE): Up to 5 attempts, 10ms apart
ACMD41 (init): Up to 200 attempts (spec allows 1 second)
Normal commands: No retries
```

**Layer 3 (API)**: Caller's responsibility.
```spin2
' Caller retry pattern:
repeat 3
  status := sd.read(handle, @buffer, 512)
  if status == sd.SUCCESS
    quit
  waitms(100)
```

### Rationale

The driver cannot know if a retry is safe:
- Was partial data written before failure?
- Is the card in an inconsistent state?
- Should we re-seek before retrying?

Only the caller has context to make these decisions.

### Critical Bug Fix Required

The current `readSector()` has an infinite loop waiting for the start token:

```pasm2
' CURRENT (BUG - hangs forever):
.startloop
                testp     _miso         wc
  if_c          jmp       #.startloop       ' ← No timeout!

' FIXED:
                GETCT     timeout
                ADDCT1    timeout, ##clkfreq    ' 1 second
.startloop
                POLLCT1   WC
  if_c          jmp       #.timeout_error       ' Bail on timeout
                drvh      _sck
                drvl      _sck
                testp     _miso         wc
  if_c          jmp       #.startloop
```

### Decision
**Use timeouts at SPI level; let callers decide on retries.** Fix the `readSector()` timeout bug immediately (Sprint Task 2.4).

---

## Decision 9: Multi-Block Operations (CMD18/CMD25)

### The Question
Should we implement multi-block read/write operations, or continue with single-sector operations?

### Analysis

**Single-sector approach** (current):
```
Read 64 sectors:
  64× CMD17 → R1 → wait token → 512 bytes → CRC → CS high
  = 64× command overhead
```

**Multi-block approach**:
```
Read 64 sectors:
  1× CMD18 → R1 → (wait token → 512 bytes → CRC) × 64 → CMD12
  = 1× command overhead + stop command
```

### Performance Impact

| Operation | Single-Sector | Multi-Block | Expected Gain |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| Read 8 sectors | 8× CMD17 | 1× CMD18 | 10-15% |
| Read 64 sectors | 64× CMD17 | 1× CMD18 | 15-25% |
| Write 8 sectors | 8× CMD24 | 1× CMD25 | 20-30% |
| Write 64 sectors | 64× CMD24 | 1× CMD25 | 30-40% |

Additional benefit: Cards internally optimize for sequential access during multi-block operations.

### Protocol Details

**Multi-Block Read (CMD18)**:
- Command: `$52` + sector + CRC
- Each sector: Wait for `$FE` token, read 512 bytes + CRC
- Stop: Send CMD12 (STOP_TRANSMISSION)

**Multi-Block Write (CMD25)**:
- Command: `$59` + sector + CRC
- Each sector: Send `$FC` token (not `$FE`!), 512 bytes + CRC, wait for response
- Stop: Send `$FD` token (not a command)

### Decision
**Implement multi-block operations in Phase 1** alongside Smart Pin SPI.

This provides:
1. Better baseline comparison data (measure gain from each optimization separately)
2. Compounded performance improvement
3. Foundation for file-level sequential I/O optimization

### Implementation
- `readSectors(start, count, p_buffer)` - CMD18 + CMD12
- `writeSectors(start, count, p_buffer)` - CMD25 + stop token
- Fall back to single-sector for count=1

See `DOCs/Plans/PHASE1-SMARTPIN-SPI.md` Tasks 1.8-1.10 for details.

## Decision 10: Single Path for All Card Access (Worker Cog Exclusive)

### The Question
Should card access ever bypass the worker cog for "simple" or "raw" operations?

### Background
The driver has two entry points:
- `mount()` - Full filesystem initialization
- `initCardOnly()` - Raw sector access without filesystem parsing

Originally, `initCardOnly()` bypassed the worker cog entirely, doing card initialization and subsequent operations directly from the calling cog. This created an architectural split where the same driver had two incompatible access patterns.

### The Problem with Dual-Path Access

```
WRONG: Dual-path architecture
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                    ┌─────────────────────┐
Cog0 calls initCardOnly() ─────────►│ Card (via Cog0)     │
                                    │ Smart pins on Cog0  │
                                    └─────────────────────┘

Later, Cog1 calls mount() ─────────►┌─────────────────────┐
                                    │ Worker on Cog1      │
                                    │ Smart pins on Cog1  │ ← CONFLICT!
                                    └─────────────────────┘
```

This caused:
1. **Pin ownership conflicts** - Two cogs configure the same pins
2. **Card state confusion** - Card initialized by Cog0, Cog1 tries to re-init
3. **Code duplication** - `if cog_id <> -1` checks scattered everywhere
4. **Testing surface doubled** - Two code paths to verify

### Decision: ALL Card Access Through Worker Cog

```
CORRECT: Single-path architecture
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                    ┌─────────────────────────────┐
                                    │      Worker Cog             │
Cog0 calls initCardOnly() ─────────►│  - Owns SPI pins            │
         or mount()                 │  - All card commands        │
                                    │  - All sector I/O           │
Cog1 calls file operations ────────►│  - CMD13 status tracking    │
                                    │  - Mode enforcement         │
                                    └─────────────────────────────┘
```

Both `initCardOnly()` and `mount()` start the worker cog. The difference:
- `initCardOnly()` → Worker initializes card only (MODE_RAW)
- `mount()` → Worker initializes card + parses filesystem (MODE_FILESYSTEM)

### Mode Management

```spin2
CON
  MODE_NONE       = 0    ' Not initialized
  MODE_RAW        = 1    ' Raw sector access only
  MODE_FILESYSTEM = 2    ' Full filesystem access

DAT
  driver_mode     BYTE    MODE_NONE
```

**Command Rejection by Mode:**

| Command | MODE_NONE | MODE_RAW | MODE_FILESYSTEM |
|---------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| `mount()` | Start worker + init | Allowed (upgrade) | Already mounted |
| `initCardOnly()` | Start worker + init | Already initialized | REJECT |
| `readSectorRaw()` | REJECT | Allowed | Allowed |
| `writeSectorRaw()` | REJECT | Allowed | Allowed |
| `openFile()` | REJECT | REJECT | Allowed |
| `read()` / `write()` | REJECT | REJECT | Allowed |
| `unmount()` | No-op | Stop worker | Close files, stop worker |

**Mode Transitions:**

| From | To | Allowed? | Method |
|------|-----|----------|--------|
| NONE → RAW | Yes | `initCardOnly()` |
| NONE → FS | Yes | `mount()` |
| RAW → FS | Yes | `mount()` - adds filesystem parsing |
| FS → RAW | **No** | Must `unmount()` first, then `initCardOnly()` |
| RAW → NONE | Yes | `unmount()` |
| FS → NONE | Yes | `unmount()` |

**Rationale for RAW → FS being allowed:**
A diagnostic tool might examine raw sectors first, then switch to filesystem mode if the card appears healthy.

**Rationale for FS → RAW being rejected:**
If files are open, dropping to raw mode would corrupt the filesystem. Explicit unmount ensures proper cleanup.

### Implementation Changes Required

1. **`initCardOnly()`**: Start worker cog, send `CMD_INIT_CARD_ONLY` command
2. **Remove "direct access" fallbacks**: Delete all `if cog_id == -1` branches that do direct card access
3. **Add mode tracking**: Worker maintains `driver_mode`, rejects invalid commands
4. **Format utility**: Works unchanged - uses `initCardOnly()` which now goes through worker
5. **Verification tools**: Work unchanged - raw sector methods still available in MODE_RAW

### Decision
**ALL card hardware access goes through the worker cog. No exceptions.**

This eliminates pin conflicts, simplifies testing, and enforces clean mode transitions.

## Decision 11: Three Separate Sector Buffers in Hub RAM

### The Question
How many sector buffers should the driver maintain, and where should they reside?

### Options Considered

1. **Single buffer (512 bytes)** - All sector types share one buffer
2. **Two buffers (1024 bytes)** - FAT separate, data/directory combined
3. **Three buffers (1536 bytes)** - FAT, directory, and data each have dedicated buffers
4. **LUT/Cog RAM buffers** - Use cog's 4KB local memory instead of hub RAM

### Memory Architecture Constraint: Spin2 Interpreter Occupies Cog/LUT RAM

The Spin2 interpreter is approximately **4,784 bytes** - larger than cog RAM alone. It spans:

| Memory | Size | Contents When Running Spin2 |
|--------|------|----------------------------|
| Cog RAM | 2KB | Core interpreter code (loaded at boot) |
| LUT RAM | 2KB | Extended interpreter code (loaded by interpreter) |
| Hub RAM | Variable | Hub-exec portions, bytecode, user data |

**Implication**: When running Spin2, both cog RAM and LUT RAM are occupied by the interpreter. **User data must reside in hub RAM** - there is no alternative for a Spin2-based driver.

### Streamer Constraint: Cannot Write to Cog/LUT RAM

Even if we rewrote the driver in pure PASM (freeing cog/LUT for data), the P2 streamer has a fundamental limitation:

- **Streamer capture modes** (`X_1P_1DAC1_WFBYTE`, etc.) write to hub RAM via WRFAST
- **There is no streamer mode that writes to cog or LUT RAM**
- The `X_*_LUT` modes are for OUTPUT (LUT → pins), not INPUT (pins → LUT)

Data flow would still require hub RAM as an intermediary:
```
SD Card → Streamer → Hub RAM (required) → SETQ+RDLONG → Cog RAM
```

The extra copy overhead would likely negate any benefit from faster cog RAM access.

### Cache Thrashing Analysis

The critical factor for buffer count is **cache thrashing** during compound operations. Consider reading a 64KB file spanning 8 clusters:

**With 3 buffers (current architecture)**:
```
Read FAT for cluster 1    → FAT buffer loaded (1 read)
Read 8 data sectors       → Data buffer used (8 reads)
Read FAT for cluster 2    → FAT buffer STILL VALID (0 reads - cached!)
Read 8 data sectors       → Data buffer used (8 reads)
... repeat ...

Total: ~72 sector reads (FAT lookups mostly cached)
```

**With 1 buffer (hypothetical)**:
```
Read FAT for cluster 1    → Buffer loaded with FAT (1 read)
Read data sector 0        → Buffer reloaded with data (1 read) - FAT evicted!
Read data sector 1        → Buffer reloaded (1 read)
... after 8 data sectors ...
Read FAT for cluster 2    → Buffer reloaded with FAT (1 read) - data evicted!
Read data sector 0        → Buffer reloaded with data (1 read)
... constant thrashing ...

Total: ~136 sector reads (every operation evicts the previous)
```

**Performance Impact**:

| Configuration | Thrashing Behavior | Performance Impact |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 3 buffers | FAT, DIR, DATA cached independently | Optimal |
| 2 buffers | FAT cached; DIR/DATA may thrash | ~10-20% slower |
| 1 buffer | Constant thrashing | ~50-100% slower |

### When Each Buffer Configuration Makes Sense

**3 buffers is optimal when:**
- Large files span multiple clusters (most real-world use)
- Directory searches in directories with many entries
- Mixed operations (read file, check directory, read another file)

**2 buffers might suffice when:**
- Files are always in single clusters
- Operations are purely sequential with no directory interaction

**1 buffer is problematic for:**
- Nearly all real filesystem operations beyond trivial single-sector access

### Hub RAM Cost is Negligible

The P2 has **512 KB of hub RAM**. Buffer memory cost:

| Configuration | Memory | % of Hub RAM |
|---------------|--------|--------------|
| 1 buffer | 512 bytes | 0.1% |
| 2 buffers | 1,024 bytes | 0.2% |
| 3 buffers | 1,536 bytes | 0.3% |

The additional 512-1024 bytes for multiple buffers is trivial compared to the potential 50-100% performance degradation from cache thrashing.

### Decision
**Use three separate sector buffers in hub RAM:**

```spin2
DAT
  dir_buf       BYTE    0[512]    ' Directory sector buffer
  fat_buf       BYTE    0[512]    ' FAT sector buffer
  buf           BYTE    0[512]    ' Data sector buffer

  dir_sec_in_buf LONG   0         ' Directory sector currently cached
  fat_sec_in_buf LONG   0         ' FAT sector currently cached
  sec_in_buf     LONG   0         ' Data sector currently cached
```

**Rationale:**
1. **Hub RAM is the only option** - Spin2 interpreter occupies cog/LUT RAM
2. **Streamer requires hub RAM** - Even pure PASM can't avoid hub as intermediary
3. **Cache thrashing is expensive** - 50-100% performance loss with single buffer
4. **Memory cost is negligible** - 1.5KB of 512KB hub RAM (0.3%)
5. **Complexity is minimal** - Each buffer has simple independent cache tracking

**Future consideration**: If memory becomes critical, the directory buffer could merge with the data buffer (2-buffer configuration) since directory and data operations rarely interleave. The FAT buffer should always remain separate.

## Summary: Why This Architecture

| Component | Decision | P2-Specific Reason |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Cog model | Dedicated worker | Per-cog DIR/OUT registers |
| Worker language | Spin2 + inline PASM2 | SD card is bottleneck, not P2 |
| State sharing | DAT block singleton | Spin2 memory model |
| Signaling | COGATN | Zero-cost waiting, instant wake |
| SPI method | Smart Pins (revised) | Sysclk independence, higher throughput |
| Multi-block | CMD18/CMD25 | Reduced command overhead |
| Streamer | Hub DMA for sectors | Zero-CPU bulk transfers |
| Buffers | 3× hub RAM | Spin2 occupies cog/LUT; streamer needs hub |
| Errors | Negative codes, per-cog | Thread-safe multi-cog access |
| Failures | Timeouts, not retries | Caller has context to decide |

These decisions work together to create a driver that is:
- **Safe**: Multiple cogs can call APIs without conflicts
- **Efficient**: COGATN signaling, optimal FIFO usage
- **Reliable**: Timeout protection prevents hangs
- **Maintainable**: Spin2 for logic, PASM2 only where needed

## Decision 12: CRC Validation for Data Integrity (2026-01-30)

### The Question
Should the driver validate CRC-16 checksums on sector transfers, or continue accepting data without verification?

### Current Behavior (PROBLEMATIC)

The SD SPI protocol includes CRC-16 checksums on all data transfers:
- **Reads:** Card sends 512 bytes + 2-byte CRC-16
- **Writes:** Host sends 512 bytes + 2-byte CRC-16

Currently, the driver:
1. **Reads:** Receives CRC bytes but discards them without validation
2. **Writes:** Sends dummy `$FF $FF` instead of calculated CRC

This works because **CRC checking is disabled by default in SPI mode** after card initialization. The card accepts any CRC value on writes and sends valid CRC on reads (which we ignore).

### The Risk: Silent Data Corruption

**The SPI bus is the vulnerable link in the data path:**

```
┌─────────┐     SPI Bus      ┌─────────┐     Internal     ┌───────┐
│   P2    │ ←──────────────→ │ SD Card │ ←──────────────→ │ Flash │
│  (Host) │   CRC protects   │Controller│   ECC protects   │Memory │
└─────────┘   THIS segment   └─────────┘   THIS segment   └───────┘
```

- **SD card internal ECC:** Protects flash memory from bit rot - always active
- **SPI CRC-16:** Protects data in transit - currently NOT validated

**Without CRC validation, corruption goes undetected:**

| Scenario | Consequence |
|----------|-------------|
| 270 MHz timing issues | Silent byte mismatches (documented: 3,472+ bytes in tests) |
| Electrical noise | Random bit flips accepted as valid data |
| FAT table corruption | Lost files, cross-linked clusters |
| Directory corruption | Files disappear, wrong metadata |
| File data corruption | Documents/code silently damaged |

**Cross-platform impact:** When the card is moved to Windows/macOS/Linux, filesystem damage becomes visible. The OS may attempt "repair" that deletes files.

### What Other Systems Do

| System | CRC Handling |
|--------|--------------|
| Linux SD driver | CRC enabled, validated |
| Windows SD driver | CRC enabled, validated |
| Commercial firmware | CRC enabled for reliability |
| Hobby/simple drivers | Often disabled for simplicity |

### P2 Hardware CRC Support

The P2 has hardware-accelerated CRC calculation:

```spin2
' Calculate CRC-16-CCITT over 512 bytes
crc := GETCRC(@buffer, $1021, 512)
```

**Performance:** ~8 + (512 × 2) = ~1032 clocks = ~3.2 µs at 320 MHz

**Comparison to transfer time:** Sector transfer at 25 MHz SPI takes ~200 µs. CRC calculation adds only 1.6% overhead.

### CRC-16-CCITT Specification

SD cards use CRC-16-CCITT:
- **Polynomial:** x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1 = `$1021`
- **Initial value:** `$0000`
- **Bit order:** MSB-first (matches SD card SPI mode)

### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Read-side CRC validation (detect corruption)**
```spin2
' After streamer receives 512 bytes:
calculated_crc := GETCRC(@buf, $1021, 512) & $FFFF
received_crc := (crc_hi << 8) | crc_lo

if calculated_crc <> received_crc
  debug("CRC MISMATCH: calc=$", uhex_(calculated_crc), " recv=$", uhex_(received_crc))
  return E_CRC_ERROR
```

**Phase 2: Write-side CRC generation (enable card-side validation)**
```spin2
' Before sending CRC bytes:
calculated_crc := GETCRC(@buf, $1021, 512)
sp_transfer_8(calculated_crc >> 8)    ' CRC high byte
sp_transfer_8(calculated_crc & $FF)   ' CRC low byte
```

**Phase 3: Enable card CRC checking**
```spin2
' During card init, after ACMD41:
cmd(59, 1)    ' CMD59: CRC_ON_OFF, arg=1 enables CRC checking
```

### Decision

**IMPLEMENT full CRC-16 validation for all sector transfers:**

1. **Calculate and validate CRC on reads** - Detect SPI transfer corruption
2. **Calculate and send valid CRC on writes** - Enable card-side validation
3. **Enable card CRC checking via CMD59** - Card rejects corrupted writes

**Rationale:**
- P2 hardware CRC adds negligible overhead (~1.6%)
- Detects timing-related corruption (270 MHz issues would be caught)
- Matches production-quality drivers (Linux, Windows)
- Essential for reliable cross-platform SD card interchange
- Debugging value: CRC errors pinpoint SPI transfer problems vs. software bugs

**Implementation sequence:**
1. Add CRC validation to driver
2. Verify all existing tests pass at 320 MHz
3. Then explore lower clock frequencies with CRC as a diagnostic tool

### Implementation Notes (2026-01-31)

**Status: SOLVED** - The P2 GETCRC algorithm has been deciphered and validated.

#### The Problem (Previous Attempt)

Initial attempts using `GETCRC(@data, $1021, 512)` failed because:
- P2's GETCRC processes data LSB-first (reflected algorithm)
- P2's GETCRC has a non-zero "base value" for zero data
- Simple polynomial choices ($1021, $8408) didn't produce matching CRCs

#### The Solution: Discovered 2026-01-31

Through exhaustive testing of single-byte and multi-byte patterns, the exact relationship was determined:

```spin2
CON
    CRC_POLY_REFLECTED = $8408       ' CRC-16-CCITT reflected polynomial
    CRC_BASE_512       = $2C68       ' GETCRC of 512 zero bytes

PRI calcCRC16(pData, len) : crc | raw
    '' Calculate CRC-16-CCITT using P2's GETCRC instruction
    '' Matches the standard lookup table algorithm
    raw := GETCRC(pData, CRC_POLY_REFLECTED, len)
    crc := ((raw ^ CRC_BASE_512) REV 31) >> 16
```

**Key Constants:**
| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `CRC_POLY_REFLECTED` | `$8408` | CRC-16-CCITT polynomial in LSB-first form |
| `CRC_BASE_512` | `$2C68` | GETCRC(@zeros, $8408, 512) - the "base" offset |

**The Algorithm:**
1. **GETCRC** with reflected polynomial `$8408` on the raw data
2. **XOR** the result with the precomputed base value (`$2C68` for 512 bytes)
3. **REV 31** reverses all 32 bits (converts LSB-first to MSB-first)
4. **>> 16** extracts the 16-bit CRC from the upper half

#### Why This Works

P2's GETCRC uses a LSB-first (reflected) algorithm with internal quirks:
1. It produces non-zero output for zero input (the "base value")
2. It processes bits in LSB-first order
3. The polynomial must be in reflected form ($8408 = REV16($1021))

The transformation:
- XOR with base removes P2's internal offset
- REV 31 + >>16 converts from LSB-first 32-bit to MSB-first 16-bit

#### Validation Results

Tested 10 different 512-byte patterns (all zeros, all $FF, sequential, random, etc.):
```
Pattern 1:  Table=$0000 GETCRC=$0000 MATCH!
Pattern 2:  Table=$7FA1 GETCRC=$7FA1 MATCH!
Pattern 3:  Table=$40DA GETCRC=$40DA MATCH!
Pattern 4:  Table=$0BA4 GETCRC=$0BA4 MATCH!
Pattern 5:  Table=$A521 GETCRC=$A521 MATCH!
Pattern 6:  Table=$DA80 GETCRC=$DA80 MATCH!
Pattern 7:  Table=$7EF5 GETCRC=$7EF5 MATCH!
Pattern 8:  Table=$BEB3 GETCRC=$BEB3 MATCH!
Pattern 9:  Table=$3515 GETCRC=$3515 MATCH!
Pattern 10: Table=$D1EE GETCRC=$D1EE MATCH!
```

**Result: 100% match with lookup table across all test patterns.**

#### Benefits

1. **Eliminates 512-byte lookup table** - Saves code space
2. **Uses hardware acceleration** - GETCRC is ~1032 cycles for 512 bytes (~3.2µs at 320MHz)
3. **Minimal overhead** - Only 1.6% of sector transfer time
4. **Single formula** - Two lines of code replaces 256-entry table

#### Implementation for Driver

```spin2
DAT
    crc_base_512    LONG    $2C68    ' Precomputed: GETCRC(@zeros, $8408, 512)

PRI calcSectorCRC(pBuf) : crc | raw
    '' Calculate CRC-16-CCITT for a 512-byte sector
    '' Uses P2 hardware GETCRC with transformation
    raw := GETCRC(pBuf, $8408, 512)
    crc := ((raw ^ crc_base_512) REV 31) >> 16

PRI validateReadCRC(pBuf, received_crc) : valid
    '' Validate CRC on received sector data
    valid := calcSectorCRC(pBuf) == received_crc

PRI generateWriteCRC(pBuf) : crc_hi, crc_lo | crc
    '' Generate CRC bytes for sector write
    crc := calcSectorCRC(pBuf)
    crc_hi := crc >> 8
    crc_lo := crc & $FF
```

#### Test File Location

The solution test file is: `TestCard/SD_CRC_solution_test.spin2`

Run with: `./run_test.sh ../TestCard/SD_CRC_solution_test.spin2`

### Error Handling

When CRC mismatch is detected:
```spin2
E_CRC_ERROR = -4    ' Already defined in error codes
```

- **Reads:** Return `E_CRC_ERROR`, do not use buffer data
- **Writes:** Card returns Data Response `$0B` (CRC error), return `E_CRC_ERROR`
- **Caller decides:** Retry, abort, or report to user
