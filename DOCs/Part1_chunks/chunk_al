•

NSAC
Defines the worst case for the clock-dependent factor of the data access time. The unit for NSAC is 100
clock cycles. Therefore, the maximal value for the clock-dependent part of the data access time is 25.5 k
clock cycles.
The total access time NAC as expressed in the Table 4-59 is the sum of TAAC and NSAC. It should be
computed by the host for the actual clock rate. The read access time should be interpreted as a typical
delay for the first data bit of a data block or stream.

Table 5-6 : Maximum Data Transfer Rate Definition
Note that for current SD Memory Cards, this field shall be always 0_0110_010b (032h) which is equal to
25 MHz - the mandatory maximum operating frequency of SD Memory Card.
In High-Speed mode, this field shall be always 0_1011_010b (05Ah) which is equal to 50 MHz, and when
the timing mode returns to the default by CMD6 or CMD0 command, its value will be 032h.

•

CCC
The SD Memory Card command set is divided into subsets (command classes). The card command class
register CCC defines which command classes are supported by this card. A value of 1 in a CCC bit means
that the corresponding command class is supported. For command class definitions, refer to Table 4-21.

•

READ_BL_LEN
The maximum read data block length is computed as 2READ_BL_LEN. The maximum block length might
therefore be in the range 512...2048 bytes (Refer to 4.3.3 for details). Note that in an SD Memory Card
the WRITE_BL_LEN is always equal to READ_BL_LEN

•

READ_BL_PARTIAL (always = 1 in SD Memory Card)
Partial Block Read is always allowed in an SD Memory Card. It means that smaller blocks can be used
as well. The minimum block size will be one byte.

• WRITE_BLK_MISALIGN
Defines if the data block to be written by one command can be spread over more than one physical block
of the memory device. The size of the memory block is defined in WRITE_BL_LEN.
WRITE_BLK_MISALIGN=0 signals that crossing physical block boundaries is invalid.
WRITE_BLK_MISALIGN=1 signals that crossing physical block boundaries is allowed.

• READ_BLK_MISALIGN
Defines if the data block to be read by one command can be spread over more than one physical block
of the memory device. The size of the memory block is defined in READ_BL_LEN.
READ_BLK_MISALIGN=0 signals that crossing physical block boundaries is invalid.
READ_BLK_MISALIGN=1 signals that crossing physical block boundaries is allowed.

•

DSR_IMP
Defines if the configurable driver stage is integrated on the card. If set, a driver stage register (DSR) shall
be implemented (also see Section 5.5).

C_SIZE
This parameter is used to compute the user's data card capacity (not include the security protected area).
The memory capacity of the card is computed from the entries C_SIZE, C_SIZE_MULT and
READ_BL_LEN as follows:
memory capacity = BLOCKNR * BLOCK_LEN
Where
BLOCKNR = (C_SIZE+1) * MULT
MULT = 2C_SIZE_MULT+2
(C_SIZE_MULT < 8)
BLOCK_LEN = 2READ_BL_LEN,
(READ_BL_LEN < 12)
To indicate 2 GByte card, BLOCK_LEN shall be 1024 bytes.
Therefore, the maximal capacity that can be coded is 4096*512*1024 = 2 G bytes.
Example: A 32 Mbyte card with BLOCK_LEN = 512 can be coded by C_SIZE_MULT = 3 and C_SIZE =
2000.
The Maximum Data Area size of Standard Capacity SD Card is 4,153,344 sectors (2028MB).

•

VDD_R_CURR_MIN, VDD_W_CURR_MIN
The maximum values for read and write currents at the minimal power supply VDD are coded as follows:

ERASE_BLK_EN
The ERASE_BLK_EN defines the granularity of the unit size of the data to be erased. The erase operation
can erase either one or multiple units of 512 bytes or one or multiple units (or sectors) of SECTOR_SIZE
(see definition below).
If ERASE_BLK_EN=0, the host can erase one or multiple units of SECTOR_SIZE. The erase will start
from the beginning of the sector that contains the start address to the end of the sector that contains the
end address. For example, if SECTOR_SIZE=31 and the host sets the Erase Start Address to 5 and the
Erase End Address to 40, the physical blocks from 0 to 63 will be erased as shown in Figure 5-1.

number of write blocks (see WRITE_BL_LEN). The actual size is computed by increasing this number by
one. A value of zero means one write block, 127 means 128 write blocks.

•

WP_GRP_SIZE
The size of a write protected group. The content of this register is a 7-bit binary coded value, defining the
number of erase sectors (see SECTOR_SIZE). The actual size is computed by increasing this number

shown in Table 5-15 (Refer to FILE_FORMAT).

•

COPY
Defines whether the contents is original (=0) or has been copied (=1). Setting this bit to 1 indicates that
the card content is a copy. The COPY bit is a one time programmable bit except ROM card.

•

PERM_WRITE_PROTECT
Permanently protects the entire card content against overwriting or erasing (all write and erase commands
for this card are permanently disabled). The default value is 0, i.e. not permanently write protected.

•

TMP_WRITE_PROTECT
Temporarily protects the entire card content from being overwritten or erased (all write and erase
commands for this card are temporarily disabled). This bit can be set and reset. The default value is 0,
i.e. not write protected.

•

WP_UPC
Write protect until power cycle protects the entire card content from being overwritten or erased (all write
and erase commands for this card are temporarily disabled). This bit can be set (Write Protect) and reset
(No Write Protect). A power cycle will reset this bit. The default value is 0, i.e., No Write Protect. If
WP_UPC_SUPPORT in SD Status indicates 0, this bit cannot be set to 1 and always indicates 0.

5.4 RCA register
The writable 16-bit relative card address register carries the card address that is published by the card
during the card identification. This address is used for the addressed host-card communication after the
card identification procedure. The default value of the RCA register is 0x0000. The value 0x0000 is
reserved to set all cards into the Stand-by State with CMD7.
In UHS-II mode, Node ID is used as RCA. Refer to SD-TRAN Section of UHS-II Addendum for more
details.

5.5 DSR register (Optional)
The 16-bit driver stage register is described in detail in Section 6.5. It can be optionally used to improve
the bus performance for extended operating conditions (depending on parameters like bus length, transfer
rate or number of cards). The CSD register carries the information about the DSR register usage. The
default value of the DSR register is 0x404.

5.6 SCR register
In addition to the CSD register, there is another configuration register named SD CARD Configuration
Register (SCR). SCR provides information on the SD Memory Card's special features that were
configured into the given card. The size of SCR register is 64 bits. This register shall be set in the factory
by the SD Memory Card manufacturer.
