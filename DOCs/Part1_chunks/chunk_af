turn.
 Broadcast commands with response (bcr)
response from all cards simultaneously - Since there is no Open Drain mode in SD Memory Card,
this type of command shall be used only if all the CMD lines are separated - the command will be
accepted and responded by every card separately.
 Addressed (point-to-point) commands (ac)
no data transfer on DAT
 Addressed (point-to-point) data transfer commands (adtc)
data transfer on DAT
All commands and responses are sent over the CMD line of the SD Memory Card. The command
transmission always starts with the left bit of the bit string corresponding to the command codeword.

4.7.2 Command Format
All commands have a fixed code length of 48 bits.

A command always starts with a start bit (always 0), followed by the bit indicating the direction of
transmission (host = 1). The next 6 bits indicate the index of the command, this value being interpreted
as a binary coded number (between 0 and 63). Some commands need an argument (e.g. an address),
which is coded by 32 bits. A value denoted by 'x' in the table above indicates this variable is dependent
on the command. All commands are protected by a CRC (see Section 4.5 for the definition of CRC7).
Every command codeword is terminated by the end bit (always 1). All commands and their arguments
are listed in Table 4-23 to Table 4-33.

4.7.3 Command Classes
The command set of the SD Memory Card system is divided into several classes (See Table 4-21). Each
class supports a set of card functionalities.
Table 4-21 determines the setting of CCC from the card supported commands. A CCC bit, which
corresponds to a supported command number, is set to 1. A class in CCC includes mandatory commands
is always set to 1. Cards with specific functions may need to support some optional commands. For
example, Combo Card shall support CMD5.
Class 0, 2, 4, 5 and 8 are mandatory and shall be supported by all SD Memory Cards. Class 7 except
CMD40 is mandatory for SDHC, SDXC and SDUC. The other classes are optional. The supported Card
Command Classes (CCC) are coded as a parameter in the card specific data (CSD) register of each card,
providing the host with information on how to access the card.
If different types of commands are assigned to a Command Class (Class 7, Class 8 and Class 11), which
command supported can be determined by referring command support information in SCR register.

SET_BLOCKLEN

In the case of a Standard Capacity SD

block length (in bytes) for all following
block commands (read, write, lock).
Default block length is fixed to 512
Bytes. Set length is valid for memory
access commands only if partial block
read operation are allowed in CSD.
In the case of SDHC, SDXC and SDUC
Cards, block length set by CMD16
command does not affect memory read
and write commands. Always 512 Bytes
fixed block length is used. This
command is effective for
LOCK_UNLOCK command.
In both cases, if block length is set larger
than 512Bytes, the card sets the
BLOCK_LEN_ERROR bit.
In DDR50 mode, data is sampled on
both edges of the clock. Therefore, block
length shall always be even.

and SDUC card. XPC=0 means
0.36W (100mA at 3.6V on VDD1)
(max.) but speed class is not
supported. XPC=1 means 0.54W
(150mA at 3.6V on VDD1) (max.)
and speed class is supported.
