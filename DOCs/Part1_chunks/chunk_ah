4.10.2 SD Status
The SD Status contains status bits that are related to the SD Memory Card proprietary features and may
be used for future application-specific usage. The size of the SD Status is one data block of 512 bit. The
content of this register is transmitted to the Host over the DAT bus along with a 16-bit CRC. The SD Status
is sent to the host over the DAT bus as a response to ACMD13 (CMD55 followed with CMD13). ACMD13
can be sent to a card only in 'tran_state' (card is selected). The SD Status structure is described in below.
Unused reserved bits shall be set to 0.
The same abbreviation for 'type' and 'clear condition' were used as for the Card Status above.

4.13 Speed Class Specification
This section provides descriptions of several speed class methods. Each classifies card performance by
a speed class number and offers a method to calculate performance. These methods enable the host to
support AV applications to perform real time recording to an SD memory card. The following sections
describe the speed class methods for the card.
Section 4.13.1 and 4.13.2 provides a description of the Speed Class specification. The Speed Class
specification is supported by SDHC, SDXC and SDUC cards. Speed Class 2, Speed Class 4, Speed
Class 6, and Speed Class 10 are defined in this method.
Section 4.13.3 provides a description of the UHS Speed Grade specification. The UHS Speed Grade
specification is supported by SDHC, SDXC and SDUC cards. UHS Speed Grade 1 and UHS Speed
Grade 3 are defined in this method,
Section 4.13.4 provides a description of the Video Speed Class specification. The Video Speed Class
specification is supported by SDHC, SDXC and SDUC cards. Video Speed Class 6, Video Speed Class
10, Video Speed Class 30, Video Speed Class 60 and Video Speed Class 90 are defined in this method.
Section 4.13.5 and 8.4 provide a description of the SD Express Speed Class specification. The SD
Express Speed Class specification is supported by SDXC and SDUC cards over PCIe bus. In other words,
this specification is applied to SD Express card only. SD Express Speed Class 150, SD Express Speed
Class 300, SD Express Speed Class 450, and SD Express Speed Class 600 are defined in this method.
In version 4.20 or earlier, implementation of the Speed Class was mandatory for SDHC and SDXC cards
and the UHS Speed Grade method was optional for all types of cards. From version 5.00, implementation
of Speed Class was changed to optional for all types of cards.
Figure 4-46 specifies the speed classes that are supported by each interface mode.

4.13.1 Speed Class Specification for SDSC and SDHC
4.13.1.1 Allocation Unit (AU)
The User Area is divided into units called "Allocation Unit (AU)" (Refer to Figure 4-47). AU is physical
boundary in User Area of a card and is not defined by the file system boundary. Each card has its own
fixed AU Size (SAU) and the maximum AU Size is defined depending on the card's capacity. The host
should manage data areas with the unit of AU. If the first AUs in the card contain file system information
then they should not be used for real time recording. An AV application should start recording from the
first complete AU, to which only user data can be recorded. Note that this specification does not apply to
the Protected Area.

Figure 4-47 : Definition of Allocation Unit (AU)
4.13.1.2 Recording Unit (RU)
Each AU is divided into units called "Recording Unit (RU)" (Refer to Figure 4-47). The unit of RU Size
(SRU) is 16KByte. The RU Size is a multiple of 16KByte and shall not span across an AU boundary.
Larger RU size may improve performance. The condition and requirement of the minimum RU Size is
defined by Section 4.13.1.8.1. The number of RUs in an AU (NRU) is calculated from SAU/SRU.
4.13.1.3 Write Performance
Figure 4-48 shows the typical data management of the card when the host writes RUs of an AU. When
the host writes to a fragmented AU, the card prepares a new AU by copying the used RUs and writing the
new RUs. The location A is at the start of the AU boundary and location B is at the end of the AU boundary.
From A to B, the host shall write data to free RUs contiguously and skip used RUs (shall not skip any free
RU). The card may indicate busy to the host, so the host can wait, during the time the card controller is
writing and moving data. The total write time from A to B can be calculated by summing up the write time
of free RUs and the moving time of the used RUs. The number of used RUs (Nu) is available by counting
it over one AU and number of free RUs is expressed by (NRU – Nu).

Figure 4-48 : Example of Writing Fragmented AU
The average Performance of a Fragmented AU can be calculated by dividing the number of free RUs by
the total execution time. It is expressed by using Performance Wite (Pw) and Performance Move (Pm).

..........................(1)
( N RU  Nu ) Pm  NuPw

The Performance Write (Pw) is defined as a minimum average write performance over an AU. It is
calculated by taking the average of all sequential RU write operations to one complete AU, which is not
fragmented. Pw is not influenced even if read operations are inserted between write operations.
The Performance Move (Pm) is defined as a minimum average move performance. It is calculated by
taking the average over sequential RU move operations to one complete AU. A move is an internal
operation of the card, so SD clock frequency does not affect the time of the move operation. In case the
card does not have to move RU, Pm should be considered as infinity (1/Pm = 0). Refer to Table 4-61 for
the values defined for each Speed Class.
Note that a Speed Class that supports Class10 shall not use the Pm value stored in the SD Status to
calculate performance in any fragmented AU. Class 10 performance is defined only for entirely free AUs.
Application Notes:
Performance may increase when larger data is written by one multiple write command. Therefore, the
host may use larger RU sizes and transfer multiple RUs with one multiple-write command.

4.13.1.4 Read Performance
Two kinds of read performances are defined. It is possible to insert either type of read operation during
write operations. All read operations, regardless of read address shall meet this performance
specification.
(1) Read Performance of Stream Data
This is simply called Read Performance (Pr). Pr is defined as minimum average random RU read
performance. The average is measured over 256 random single RU read operations. Each RU is read
by a multiple-read command. Pr shall be greater than or equal to Pw.
(2) FAT and Directory Entry Read Time
TFR(4KB) is defined as the maximum time to read a 4KB FAT and Directory Entry. The FAT and
Directory Entry Read Time (SFR [KB]) is defined using the CEIL function:

 S FR 
 TFR (4 KB) ...............................................(2)
 4 KB 

FAT Read Time of SFR [KB]: TFR ( S FR )  

(CEIL function - Convert decimal fraction x to the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.)
Refer to Table 4-61 for the values defined for each Speed Class.

4.13.1.5 Performance Curve Definition
Figure 4-49 shows the write performance bar chart of P(Nu) of equitation (1). An AU consists of 16 RUs
in this example. Joining the points of each bar shows the performance curve, which can be determined
from the two parameters, Pw and Pm.

Figure 4-49 : Card Performances between 16 RUs
The ratio of used RU (r) is defined as:

r

Nu
,
N RU

Nu  rN RU

The range of r is 0 to 1. (1 – r) means ratio of free RU, r=0 means all RUs are free. r=1 means all RUs
are used and performance indicates zero at this point. By using r, Equation (1) is transformed into
Equation (3).
Performance Curve: P ( r ) 

(1  r ) PwPm
rPw  (1  r ) Pm

0  r  1 ...........................................(3)

P(Nu) in Equation (1) is a discrete function but P(r) is treated as a continuous function.

4.13.1.6 Speed Class Definition
Figure 4-50 shows three performance curves. Pw indicates the performance of r=0 and Pm determines
the shape of the curve. All performance curves converge at the point (1, 0). Therefore, there is little
difference in performance where r is near to 1. These three curves divide the performance into four speed
classes: Class 0, Class 2, Class4 and Class 6. The Class 0 card provides no guarantee to be compliant
to the Speed Class Specification. It does not report performance parameters even if the cards can achieve
performance of higher speed classes. Class 0 also covers all legacy SD products prior to the introduction
of this specification. The Classes are defined so that an AV application, such as MPEG2 recording, can
support an SD card device. The performance of a Speed Class 2 card shall be higher than performance
curve 2. It is defined for standard TV image quality; approximately 2MB/sec performance will be required.
The performance of a Speed Class 4 card shall be higher than performance curve 4. Speed Class 4 is
defined for HD video quality; approximately 4MB/sec performance will be required. Higher classes can
be added in the future, if required. It is important that the host shall always accept cards which meet
141

©Copyright 2001-2023 KIOXIA, Panasonic Connect, SanDisk and SD Card Association
Physical Layer Simplified Specification Version 9.10
minimum speed class performance.
Note that performance of Class 10 does not conform to the performance curve. Class 10 is supported
only in the case r=0.
Speed Class shall be defined as SD Bus interface level performance, though the performance curve is
derived from only back-end performance analysis in Section 4.13.1.3. SD clock frequency and RU size
are defined as measurement conditions for Speed Classes. Refer to Section 4.13.1.8.

Application Note:
For the convenience of legacy card users, the host should try to use the card that has lower
performance than expected and attempt to record if necessary. When a mode provides operation only
for specific Speed Class cards, one of the other modes should provide operation for lower Speed
Class cards including Class 0.

4.13.1.7 Consideration for Inserting FAT Update during Recording
Figure 4-51 shows the typical sequence of the FAT update cycle for real time recording. FAT updates can
be inserted between any RU accesses. The FAT update cycle consists of 3 write operations. The FAT1
and FAT2 means two FAT-table writes using one multiple write command for each FAT-table. The FAT
table write can start any 512-byte boundary address and any size up to 16 KBytes. Only modified parts
of FAT should be written. The DIR stands for directory entry write. A directory entry should be created
before recording starts and only the modified parts should be written in the directory entry (512 Bytes).
The FAT Write Time (TFW) is defined as the total time of 3 write operations of FAT update cycle. The host
shall take the sequence to be able to calculate degradation of performance by inserting a FAT update
cycle. The card requires higher Card Performance (Pc) than Application Performance (Pa) to insert FAT
update cycle. It is noted that any order of 3 write operations is allowed for FAT update. Figure 4-51 shows
an example order.

4.13.1.7.2 Maximum FAT Write Time
During a FAT update, the host cannot write data to the card. Therefore, the host should prepare enough
buffers to save the data temporarily. The Maximum FAT Write Time (TFW (max.)) is one of the factors
to determine host buffer size. During 8 times FAT write cycle, occurrence of TFW (max.) should not
appear more than once. On the method of Host Buffer Size estimation, refer to Implementation
Guideline of the Speed Class Specification.

4.13.1.8 Measurement Conditions and Requirements of the Speed Class
4.13.1.8.1 Measurement Conditions
Table 4-61 shows measurement conditions for each Speed Class. The Speed Class 10 card shall
support high speed mode. The higher Speed Class may require higher frequency or larger RU size.
These values provide margin for host applications running at maximum speed.

Application Note:
The minimum performance is measured at 100% usage rate of the SD Bus (No idle time is assumed
in accesses). Therefore, writing to the card at intervals decreases performance.
Host needs to use higher frequency clock than that of measurement condition.

4.13.1.8.2 Requirements of the Performance Parameters for Each Speed Class
Table 4-62 identifies the requirement of the parameters for each class under measurement conditions.
All conditions of any Class should apply simultaneously. Any cards having a specific Speed Class shall
also satisfy the requirements and conditions of lower Classes. For example, Class 6 card shall satisfy
Class 4 performance under Class 4 condition. Class 10 card shall satisfy Class 6 performance under
the Class 6 conditions and Class 4 performance under the Class 4 conditions (Class 4 always covers
Class 2 because of using the same conditions).
Regarding Class 10 Card, as Class 10 mode does not support Pm, the minimum requirement of Pm is
more than or equal to 2MB/sec under the Class 4 conditions and 3MB/sec under the Class 6 conditions
even if PERFORMANCE_MOVE in SD Status is set to 0.

case, if Pm=0, host should consider that Pm is half of Pw for Class 2 to 6. If host uses
Class 10 mode, Pm indicated in SD Status shall be ignored and treated as 0.
Table 4-62 : Performance Requirements for Each Class (SDSC and SDHC)
4.13.1.8.3 Requirements of SD File System
This specification can be applied only to the SD file system formatted card defined by the File System
Specification Version 3.00. This includes complying with the format parameter calculation specified in
the Appendix C of the File System Specification Ver3.00.
Furthermore, the Number of Hidden Sectors shall be adopted as minimum number that meets
Boundary Unit Recommendation for Data Area.

4.13.1.9 CMD20 Support
SDHC Memory Card may support Speed Class Control Command (CMD20) as optional. Setting SCR bit
32 to 1 indicates support of CMD20 but use of CMD20 is optional for host. Then even if a card supports
CMD20, the card shall satisfy Speed Class specification without using CMD20. Refer to Section 4.13.2.8
about CMD20 functions definition.

Physical Layer Simplified Specification Version 9.10

4.13.2 Speed Class Specification for SDXC/SDUC
Speed Class is defined for SDXC and SDUC. Though the basic concept is similar to Speed Class for
SDSC and SDHC, there are several differences. Key features of SDXC/SDUC Speed Class are listed
below.
(1) The table of valid AU sizes (Table 4-47) is updated with six values larger than 4MB. When an
AU size larger than 4MB is used, performance is measured in each of the 4MB sub-unit.
(2) RU sizes are larger and common for each card capacity range.
(3) Speed Class performance is defined only in the case of sequential writes to an entirely free AU.
No move operation is supported.
(4) The FAT Update sequence is based on the exFAT file system for SDXC/SDUC.
(5) Sequence of updating CI (Continuous Information, defined in Part2 File System Specification
Version 3.00) during stream recording is defined and supported.
(6) Speed Class Control command (CMD20) is introduced to optimize card operation for Speed
Class recording.

4.13.2.1 Speed Class Parameters
4.13.2.1.1 AU
Capacities of up to 128TB and the UHS high speed interface require larger AU sizes.
In the case of SDXC and SDUC the maximum AU size is increased to 64MB.
To record the stream data, a Speed Class host shall manage the memory area in units of an AU and
use only completely free AUs (zero fragmentation) to record the data.
Note that all AU sizes larger than 4MB are integer multiples of 4MB and performance is measured
over each 4MB sub-unit of an AU.
4.13.2.1.2 RU
The definition of an RU is the same as in SDSC and SDHC. A Speed Class host shall write data in
units of an RU.
The RU sizes are defined in Table 4-63. The same RU size is used for Class 2, 4 and 6. For Class 10,
the RU size is larger to achieve higher performance. The same RU size is applied across the entire
card capacity range (over 32GB~128TB) and varies only for each performance Class.

4.13.2.2 Write Performance
4.13.2.2.1 Measurement of Pw
Pw is measured in the case when data is written in units of RUs, from top to the bottom of an entirely
free AU. There are two cases of how to measure Pw.
1. If the AU size is equal to or smaller than 4MB;
Pw is defined as the minimum average write performance over an AU. This is the same definition
as that for SDSC and SDHC.
2. If the AU size is larger than 4MB (Always a multiple of 4MB);
Pw is defined as the minimum of the average write performance of every 4MB sub-unit in an
AU.
Figure 4-52 shows the measurement of an AU's Pw. In the figure, performance of the measured AU is
defined as the minimum of Pw1, Pw2,...PwN. The card's Pw is defined as the minimum performance
of all AUs in the memory area.
Regardless of its size, an AU is the size of the memory area to which Speed Class host shall write data
sequentially from top to the bottom in units of RU.

Figure 4-52 : Measurement of Pw (AU size is larger than 4MB)
4.13.2.2.2 Performance Move
In contrast with Speed Class for SDSC and SDHC, Pm is not supported in SDXC and SDUC. This
means that Speed Class host shall write data to the entire free AUs so that SDXC and SDUC card can
provide Class performance. Pm shall be set to 0 in SD Status of SDXC and SDUC card.
Application Note:
The amount of unwritten memory and the amount of Speed Class recordable memory may be
different. Speed Class hosts can maximize the amount of recordable memory by defragmenting
and freeing AUs for use when Speed Class performance is required.

4.13.2.3 Read Performance
The read performance of an SDXC and SDUC card has the same definition as that for SDSC and SDHC.
Pr is defined as the minimum average random RU read performance over 256 RUs. Pr shall be greater
than or equal to Pw.
TFR(4KB) is defined as the maximum time to read 4KB data.
4.13.2.4 FAT Update
The SDXC and SDUC FAT update cycle has almost the same definition as in SDSC and SDHC. The only
difference is the data type and its location. In the case of SDXC and SDUC, the FAT update cycle consists
of three write operations, FAT, Bitmap and directory entry. The FAT is written starting at any 512-byte
boundary address and with any size up to 16Kbytes. Bitmap is written starting at any 512-byte boundary
address and with any size from 512-byte to 16Kbytes.
A directory entry should be created before starting recording and the same block should be written by
512-byte single block write (either CMD24 or CMD25).
Average and Maximum FAT Write Time ( TFW (ave.) and TFW(max.) ) are the same as defined for SDSC
and SDHC. Average FAT Write time is defined as the maximum sliding average of 8 FAT update cycles.
Note that a Speed Class host can insert FAT update at any RU boundary. Insertion of FAT update never
affects Pw.
4.13.2.5 CI (Continuous Information) Update
CI (Continuous Information) is a new structure used to manage exFAT file fragments. It is newly defined
in the Part2 File System Specification Version 3.00. CI may be updated during Speed Class recording.
Creating CI is optional for the host. The specific feature of CI update is described below.

 CI can be inserted at any RU boundary. The frequency of CI update depends on the host
implementation.
If a host tries to protect recorded data from any error including power failure, it may update CI
frequently.
 A cluster is allocated to store CI and when it is filled, a new cluster is allocated. The first update of
CI in a stream recording may be written from any point in an existing cluster. After the existing cluster
is filled, a new cluster is allocated and all subsequent updates are written from the beginning to the
end before a new cluster is allocated.
 The address to which CI is written may change during a stream recording. The same address may
be overwritten several times. When the address is changed, it is always increased sequentially
within the cluster. When a CI cluster is filled and a new one is allocated, the CI cluster address is
changed randomly. (Any free cluster can be allocated).
The Speed Class specification for SDXC and SDUC defines the CI Update sequence and operation time.
The sequence is similar to the directory entry update. CI is always written by a 512-byte single block write
(either CMD24 or CMD25) and preceded by CMD20 Update CI command. The CI update operation time
is maximum 250ms.
Note that Insertion of CI update never affects Pw.
Application Note:
It is recommended that CI be updated after Speed Class recording is finished. In this case, the CI
update is performed outside of Speed Class recording and the host does not need to consider it as
overhead.

4.13.2.6 Distinction of Data Type
During Speed Class recording, several types of data (Stream data, FAT, Bitmap, directory entry and CI)
are written by the host.
To satisfy Class performance, an SDXC and SDUC card needs to distinguish between each type of data
in order to treat them properly.
For example, directory entry and CI can be distinguished by their data size (always written by 512B), so
the card can store them in separate areas from the stream data.
Locations of the FAT and bitmap are described in Section 4.13.2.7.3.
Since directory entry and CI are written by 512-byte single block write (either CMD24 or CMD25), in user
area, they should be distinguished by CMD20.
