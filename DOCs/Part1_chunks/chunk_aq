8.4.7 Power and Thermal Management
8.4.7.1 Overview
Available Maximum Powers (or PSDs) for SD Express card depend on card type as described in Section
8.1.8. In addition, NVMe specification has a feature of Host Controlled Thermal Management for
controlling card’s performance in order not to rise its composite temperature so rapidly. This card’s
343

©Copyright 2001-2023 KIOXIA, Panasonic Connect, SanDisk and SD Card Association
Physical Layer Simplified Specification Version 9.10
operation is called thermal throttling.
Since the objective of Speed Class Recording is to continue long time sequential write with guaranteeing
minimum recording performance, sudden performance degradation by thermal throttling needs to be
avoided.
This section describes a method to reduce card power consumption and to maintain the target Speed
Class in terms of card’s thermal design.

8.4.7.2 Power State Descriptor in the SD Express Card
Figure 8-24 shows an example of Power State Descriptor (PSD) in the ICDS. Each PSD is numbered
with respect to Power State and has some elements including Maximum Power (MP). When host specifies
a Power State to the card, card is allowed to consume power up to MP corresponding to the specified PS
except cases described in Section 8.4.7.5.2.
As described in Section 8.1.8, an SD Express card has some Power States which shall be supported
according to the card type. In the example of Figure 8-24, card supports 7 Power States indicated by
PSD0 through PSD6, allocated in top-aligned and descending order with respect to MP in them. In
addition, PSDs other than PSD2 and PSD4 shall be supported by this card (refer to Table 8.1.8-1).

Available PSD (or PS) shall
be assigned in top-aligned
and descending order of MP.

8.4.7.3 Thermal Management for the SD Express Speed Class
NVMe specification defines the following parameters related to the thermal management.
TMT1 and TMT2 indicate thresholds of temperature activating light thermal throttling and heavy thermal
throttling respectively. They are set to the card by arguments of Set Features command (Host Controlled
Thermal Management). If they are set to zero, the Host Controlled Thermal Management by TMT1/TMT2
is disabled. In addition, WCTEMP (Warning Composite Temperature Threshold) in the ICDS indicates the
minimum composite temperature that indicates an overheating condition. Refer to NVMe specification for
more details about these parameters.
At least, card shall be designed that its composite temperature does not to exceed WCTEMP under the
specified Power State to maintain the Speed Class Recording, as far as host keeps the card case
temperature as described in the Application Note below. Moreover, it is important not to fall the recording
speed below the target class performance by the thermal throttling. In this sense, TMT2 should be less
than or equal to WCTEMP (TMT2=WCTEMP is recommended). Note that the event that the composite
temperature gets over WCTEMP may be reported by Thermal Excursion Event when some unexpected
error happens due to not efficient heat removable.
To satisfy these conditions, power and thermal management for SD Express Speed Class is introduced
as described in Section 8.4.7.4.

344

©Copyright 2001-2023 KIOXIA, Panasonic Connect, SanDisk and SD Card Association
Physical Layer Simplified Specification Version 9.10
Application Note:
The host needs to keep card’s surface temperature to the maximum Card Case Temperature or
lower defined in Table 3-4 of the Standard Size SD Card Mechanical Addendum or Table 3-8 of the
microSD Card Addendum.
The maximum Card Case Temperature depends on the Card Power Consumption in the table which
is specified by the Maximum Power (MP) of the selected Power State Descriptor (PSD). When the
selected PSD specifies 2.5W, for example, the maximum Card Case Temperature is kept up to 73
deg.C. by the host.
In addition, if the selected MP does not exactly match to the Card Power Consumption in the table,
the higher nearest Card Power Consumption shall be referred for it. As an example, if the selected
MP is 1.6W, the maximum Card Case Temperature shall be under 75 deg.C (corresponding to
1.8W).
For thermal management, host may use card’s composite temperature obtained by SMART / Health
Information Log instead of the Card Case Temperature.

8.4.7.4 Power and Thermal Management for SD Express Speed Class
8.4.7.4.1 Managing Maximum Power Consumption during Speed Class Recording
After completing SD Express card initialization, Slot Power Limit (SPL) is set by the host depending on
host’s power capability. When host starts normal write operation (targeting best effort performance without
Speed Class Recording), it will set a PSD by Set Features command, which including the highest MP
supported by the card as far as the MP does not exceed the SPL value.
In the SD Express Speed Class, such a higher power is not required. In terms of reducing card power
consumption during the Speed Class, SD Express card supporting SD Express Speed Class shall have
Speed Class Power State (SCPS) field in the Vendor Specific area of the ICDS. This field is defined
according to each PCIe bus mode and target speed class. Refer to Table 8-20 for more details of SCPS.
Figure 8-25 shows tables of SCPS and PSD as an example. If host selects PCIe Gen3x1 mode and
intends to execute Class 150 Speed Class Recording, host reads corresponding value (84h) from the
SCPS table. Then, it refers to the PSD table, detects PSD4 (1.6W), and set it as a Power State during
Speed Class Recording by Set Features command. If TMT1 is not zero, the SCPS means a suitable
Power State for the Speed Class when the composite temperature is between TMT1 and TMT2 (refer to
Section 8.4.7.4.3 and 8.4.7.5.2).

8.4.7.4.2 Managing Composite Temperature during Speed Class Recording
As described above, card shall be designed that the composite temperature is under WCTEMP by thermal
throttling or other ways. However, the appropriate values of TMT1 and TMT2 depend on the target speed
class and card structural implementation. So, the SD Express Card supporting SD Express Speed Class
shall indicate Speed Class TMT1 and TMT2 for the Speed Class Recording in the Vendor Specific area
of the ICDS (they are defined as SCTMT1 and SCTMT2 respectively). These values are defined
according to each PCIe bus mode and target speed class. Before starting Speed Class Recording, host
reads SCTMT1 and SCTMT2 from the ICDS of the card and sets them as TMT1 and TMT2 respectively
by Set Features command.
Card may indicate SCTMT1 and SCTMT2 values by either one of methods below.
(1) If card is designed without referring to TMT1 and TMT2 for keeping Speed Class Recording, card
indicates 0 for both SCTMT1 and SCTMT2 fields. In this case, card expects to be set SCTMT1 and
SCTMT2 value (both parameters are 0) to TMT1 and TMT2 by the host respectively. If host sets nonzero values to TMT1/2, card may not guarantee the Speed Class Recording.
(2) Otherwise, card indicates appropriate values for TMT1 and TMT2 for each PCIe bus mode and target
speed class. In this case, card expects to be set SCTMT1 and SCTMT2 to TMT1 and TMT2 by the
host respectively. If host violates this rule, card may not guarantee the Speed Class Recording.
For the second method above, there are two options for card design related to its composite temperature
as described in Figure 8-26.
(a) If the card intends to maintain the target speed without any throttlings, card shall be designed in order
that its composite temperature never exceeds TMT1 (set as SCTMT1 by the host) during the Speed
Class Recording.
(b) If the card enables to maintain the target speed with the light throttling, card shall be designed in
order that its composite temperature never exceeds TMT2 (set as SCTMT2 by the host) during the
Speed Class Recording.

8.4.7.4.3 Speed Class Recording Including Power and Thermal Management
The following steps take place for executing Speed Class Recording including Power and Thermal
management. Also refer to Section 8.4.7.5 for the examples.
(1) Host sets Slot Power Limit (SPL) according to its power capability.
(2) If necessary, host reads the default PSD, TMT1 and TMT2 values from the card and stores them
before starting Speed Class Recording
(3) Host reads appropriate values of SCPS, SCTMT1 and SCTMT2 according to the selected PCIe bus
mode and target speed class (see Table 8-20), and then sets them as PSD, TMT1 and TMT2
respectively by Set Features command.
a. If zero is set to TMT1 and TMT2, Host Controlled Thermal Management by TMT1/TMT2 is
disabled. In this case, card is necessary to control power consumption up to MP specified by
the SCPS. In addition, card shall be designed to keep Speed Class Recording by retaining the
composite temperature under WCTEMP, as far as host maintains the conditions described in
the Application Note of Section 8.4.7.3.
b. If non-zero value is set to TMT1 and TMT2, card is necessary to control power consumption up
to MP specified by the SCPS. Similar to a. above, card shall be designed to keep Speed Class
Recording by retaining the composite temperature under WCTEMP (usually same as
TMT2=SCTMT2).
In this case, card may operate on a Power State whose index is less than that of specified
SCPS while the composite temperature is under TMT1, as far as the corresponding MP does
not exceed SPL. For example, when PSD2 is set to the card according to the SCPS table, card
may work at either PSD1 or PSD0 if the composite temperature is lower than TMT1.
(4) On exiting the Speed Class Recording, host may restore the saved PSD, TMT1 and TMT2 values by
Set Features command.
Application Note:
If the host does not maintain the card’s surface temperature described in the Application Note in
Section 8.4.7.3, card does not guarantee the speed class performance even host specifies the
recommended SCTMT1 and SCTMT2 values to the card.

8.4.7.5 Sample Speed Class Sequences Including Power and Thermal Management
8.4.7.5.1 In Case of SCTMT1/2=0
Figure 8-27 shows an example of SD Express Speed Class sequence when SCTMT1 and SCTMT2 are
zero. In this example, host supports PCIe Gen4x1 mode, card type is G4L1 and the target speed class is
150MB/s.

SCPS for Gen4x1 in ICDS

Figure 8-27 : Sample Speed Class Sequence Including Power and Thermal Management (1)
At the card initialization, host selects PCIe Gen4x1 mode and sets SPL=2.8W since host can supply up
to 2.8W to the SD Express card. Then, host issues Get Features command to read default settings of
PSD, TMT1 and TMT2 for storing these parameters if necessary.
After host initializes the SD Express card, it usually sets Power State whose MP is the highest one as far
as MP does not exceed the value of SPL. In this example, since the highest MP (2.8W) is equal to SPL,
PSD0 is set by Set Features command.
Before starting Speed Class Recording, host issues Identify command to get Vendor Specific parameters
for SD Express Speed Class from ICDS. At this time, host detects PSD2 (1.8W) is suitable Power State
Descriptor for this card when the target speed class is 150 over PCIe Gen4x1 mode. In addition, host
recognizes both SCTMT1 and SCTMT2 are zero. Then, host issues Set Features command to set these
parameters for executing Speed Class recording. Therefore, the MP during Speed Class Recording gets
1.8W. This means card never consumes power more than 1.8W.
After exiting from the Speed Class Recording State, host may set default parameters stored previously.
Figure 8-28 shows another example of SD Express Speed Class sequence when SCTMT1 and SCTMT2
are zero. In this example, host supports only PCIe Gen3x1 mode and can supply up to 1.8W.

Due to host’s capability, host selects PCIe Gen3x1 mode and sets SPL=1.8W. Thus, PSD2 (1.8W) is set
in this host and card combination. Since the SCPS for this condition indicates PSD2, host will set PSD2
and the maximum power consumption is still 1.8W during Speed Class Recording.

Figure 8-29 : Sample Speed Class Sequence Including Power and Thermal Management (3)
Before issuing Set Features command for setting SCPS (PSD2) and SCTMT1/2 values as Power State
and TMT1/2 respectively, host and card operations are same as those of Figure 8-27. Different from
Figure 8-27, when the composite temperature is less than TMT1 (same as SCTMT1≠0 set by the host),
349

©Copyright 2001-2023 KIOXIA, Panasonic Connect, SanDisk and SD Card Association

card may consume power between the wattage between MP designated by SCPS and SPL. In this
example, even host specifies PSD2 (whose MP is 1.8W) with reference to SCPS obtained by the card,
card may work up to 2.8W (=SPL).
When the composite temperature gets higher than or equal to TMT1, card can consume power up to
1.8W.
Figure 8-30 shows another example of SD Express Speed Class sequence when SCTMT1 and SCTMT2
are not zero. Similar to Figure 8-28, host supports only PCIe Gen3x1 mode and can supply up to 1.8W.

Like Figure 8-29, card may operate up to 1.8W (=SPL) while the composite temperature is under TMT1,
even specified PSD (PSD4 in this case) indicates its MP is equal to 1.6W. When the temperature gets
higher than or equal to TMT1, card shall work up to 1.6W as a power consumption.

8.4.8 Relationship to the Conventional Speed Classes
8.4.8.1 Supporting Speed Classes by SD Express Cards
SD Express Speed Class specification is defined independent to that of Video Speed Class. This means
all types of SD Express card described in Table 8-19 are allowed.

In addition, supporting the original speed class (C2, C4, C6, and C10) and the UHS speed grade (U1 and
U3) are also optional in SD mode for all types of SD Express Card in Table 8-19.

8.4.8.2 Operation Rules When Changing Bus Mode and Power Cycle
The following rules are applied to Type 2, 3, or 4 of the SD Express cards defined in Table 8-19.
8.4.8.2.1 Changing Bus Mode from SD to PCIe
 All registered address information of active AUs (assigned by Set Free AU) shall be cleared.
 All registered address information of DIRs (assigned by Update DIR) shall be cleared.
 The suspension address over SD bus (SUS_ADDR) is remained but inaccessible while the bus mode
is PCIe.
 If either write, erase, or Set Free AU/SGS operation is executed to the suspended AU (the AU
including SUS_ADDR) through PCIe bus, the remained SUS_ADDR is cleared.
8.4.8.2.2 Changing Bus Mode from PCIe to SD
 All of context attributes specified by DSM commands (both random and sequential) shall be cleared.
 The suspension addresses over PCIe bus (SD Express SUS_ADDR 1 through 8) are remained but
inaccessible while the bus mode is SD.
 If either write, erase, discard or Set Free AU operation is executed to the suspended SGS unit (the
unit including SD Express SUS_ADDR) through SD bus, the remained SD Express SUS_ADDR is
cleared.
8.4.8.2.3 Power Cycle
 All registered address information of active AUs (assigned by Set Free AU) shall be cleared.
 All registered address information of DIR (assigned by Update DIR) shall be cleared.
 All of context attributes specified by DSM commands (both random and sequential) shall be cleared.
 The suspension addresses over both bus mode are remained.
 If either write, erase or Set Free AU/SGS operation is executed to the suspended AU (the AU including
SUS_ADDR) through PCIe bus, the remained SUS_ADDR is cleared.
 If either write, erase, discard or Set Free AU operation is executed to the suspended SGS unit (the
unit including SD Express SUS_ADDR) through SD bus, the remained SD Express SUS_ADDR is
cleared.

8.4.8.3 Recommendation for Setting SGS and VSC_AU_SIZE
For the SD Express Type 4 card, it is preferable that both SGS value and VSC_AU_SIZE are identical.
But if it is impossible, it is recommended that SGS value is n times or 1/n times of VSC_AU_SIZE, where
n is a natural number, for the efficient use of the User Area accessed by both PCIe bus and SD bus.

8.4.9 Detecting Termination Conditions
When one of following events occur, it is impossible for card to continue Speed Class Recording for
specific stream(s) or all of them. Refer to Section 8.4.1.2 for details of Area Assignment.

351

©Copyright 2001-2023 KIOXIA, Panasonic Connect, SanDisk and SD Card Association
Physical Layer Simplified Specification Version 9.10

 Termination conditions for each stream
(1) Writing a specific stream violates the rules described in Section 8.4.1.6.
(2) Card internal error occurs for a specific stream.
 Termination conditions for all valid streams
(1) Card receives a command other than Directive Receive, Directive Send, Identify, Get Log Page,
DSM, Flush, Read or Write.
(2) Write or erase operation is executed in the Non-assigned Area.
(3) File system management information other than FAT and Allocation Bitmap is written to other area
than the Random Area allocated by Update DIR/CI. Stream data are written to other area than the
Sequential Area allocated by Set Free AU/SGS.
(4) Card internal error which is impossible to specify its SID (e.g., error during FAT update) occurs.
(5) PCIe bus error occurs.
When card detects these events, it reports by Asynchronous Event function. To enable this function, host
issues Asynchronous Event Request command before starting Speed Class Recording. When card
detects one of termination conditions during Speed Class Recording, it posts CMP of Asynchronous Event
Request in the Admin Completion Queue, whose Asynchronous Event Type is 111b (vendor specific) and
Log Page Identifier is C0h (Open SID for Speed Class). If host detects these parameters in the Dword0
of the Completion Queue Entry for the Admin Completion Queue, it should issue Get Log Page command
with Log Page Identifier = C0h and UUID for the SD Express Speed Class. By this method, host gets
SIDs that are no longer valid.
After that, host should operate Release Identifier for the invalid SID.
Refer to Section 8.4.1.7 and 8.4.10.3 for more details.

8.4.10 Vendor Specific Parameters
8.4.10.1 Getting Vendor Specific Parameters
In order that host obtains specific parameters related to SD Express Speed Class, the following two
methods are introduced.
The first one is host reads parameters from the Vendor Specific field in the ICDS by Identify command.
In this field, static parameters are indicated such as SD Express Speed Class, Speed Class Power State
and so on.
The second one is host gets parameters as a log by issuing Get Log Page command. Dynamically
changing parameters such as Open SID for Speed Class or SD Express SUS_ADDR can be obtained by
this method.
Card supporting SD Express Speed Class shall indicate the following 128-bit value as a UUID in the UUID
List defined in the NVMe specification.
UUID for SD Express Speed Class:
724e2db4-8569-406b-8ecc-b3f27f89169e
When host issues Identify or Get Log Page command to get specific parameters for SD Express Speed
Class, host needs to set UUID index specifying the UUID for SD Express Speed Class described above.

8.4.10.2 Parameters Obtained by Identify Command
8.4.10.2.1 Overview
Identify Controller Data Structure includes the Vendor Specific field as described in Figure 8-31.

SD Express Speed Class: This field indicates the SD Express Speed Class
supported by the card.
The value of this 2 Bytes field indicates the value of the speed itself guaranteed
by the SD Express Speed Class.
Any SD Express Speed Class lower than the specified Class value shall be also
supported (e.g., if the card supports SD Express Speed Class 600, then the card
also supports SD Express Speed Class 450, 300, and 150).
Higher classes may be added in the future, if required.
Considering the future extension, even an undefined value is indicated in this
field, host should not reject this card and regard that card supports its nearest
lower class. For example, if card indicates 01F4h (500) in this field, host should
recognize that card supports SD Express Speed Class 450.
If card supports TCG security (refer to Section 4.22), this field can be set based
on the performance when TCG is disabled.

Speed Class TMTs (SCTMT1, SCTMT2) for Gen3x1: This field indicates the
temperatures, in degrees Kelvin, that the host shall specify as TMT1 and TMT2
when PCIe Gen3x1 mode is selected. SCTMT1 and SCTMT2 indicated in this
field correspond to TMT1 and TMT2 specified by Set Features Command and
depend on PCIe bus mode and the target speed class. The value of 0000h
indicates invalid.
Card supporting some Speed Class shall support lower classes as well. Then,
since card supporting Class 300 or higher indicates multiple valid SCTMT1 and
SCTMT2, host should select appropriate SCTMT1 and SCTMT2 according to the
required performance by the host.
If host does not set these values as TMT1 and TMT2, unexpected thermal
throttling will happen and the SD Express Speed Class Recording may not be
able to continue.
Since the following relation MNTMT ≤ TMT1 < TMT2 ≤ MXTMT is regulated in the
NVMe spec., SCTMT1 and SCTMT2 shall satisfy the following inequality.

SUS_ADDR 1.” If the number of valid suspension addresses is less than 8, the rest of this field is filled
by zero.
The suspension address is cleared to zero by either of these events:
(1) The host issues the "Set Free AU/SGS" command to assign an SGS including the suspension
address.
(2) The host issues the "Resume AU/SGS" command specifying the suspension address.
(3) The host writes to any location within the suspended SGS unit (that includes suspension address).
(4) The host erases to any location within the suspended SGS unit.
Before issuing "Resume AU/SGS", it is recommended that host gets this list by Get Log Page command.
