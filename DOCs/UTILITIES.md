### 3. SD_speed_characterize.spin2

**Purpose:** Find maximum reliable SPI clock speed for a specific card.

**Usage:**
```bash
./run_test.sh ../src/UTILS/SD_speed_characterize.spin2 -t 300
```

**Test Strategy:**

| Phase | Test | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Phase 1** | 1,000 single-sector reads | Quick reliability check |
| **Phase 2** | 10,000 single-sector reads | Statistical confidence |
| **Phase 3** | 100 × 8-sector reads | Sustained transfer test |

Testing proceeds from lowest to highest speed. If any phase fails, testing stops for that speed and higher speeds are skipped.

**Speed Levels Tested:**
- 18 MHz, 20 MHz, 22 MHz, 25 MHz, 28 MHz
- 30 MHz, 33 MHz, 37 MHz, 40 MHz, 45 MHz, 50 MHz

**Output Includes:**
- Target frequency vs actual achievable frequency
- Delta percentage from ideal (due to P2 clock division)
- Pass/fail status for each phase
- CRC error counts and timeout counts
- Maximum reliable speed recommendation

**Sample Output:**
```
SD Card SPI Speed Characterization
==================================
Card: SanDisk Extreme 64GB

Speed Tests:
  18 MHz: Phase 1 PASS, Phase 2 PASS, Phase 3 PASS
  20 MHz: Phase 1 PASS, Phase 2 PASS, Phase 3 PASS
  25 MHz: Phase 1 PASS, Phase 2 PASS, Phase 3 PASS
  30 MHz: Phase 1 PASS, Phase 2 PASS, Phase 3 PASS
  33 MHz: Phase 1 PASS, Phase 2 FAIL (3 CRC errors)

Recommended Maximum Speed: 30 MHz
```

**Use Cases:**
- Determine safe operating speed for production
- Compare cards for speed capability
- Identify marginal cards with reliability issues
- Optimize driver configuration per card type

### 4. SD_frequency_characterize.spin2

**Purpose:** Find sysclk frequency boundaries for reliable streamer timing.

**Usage:**
```bash
./run_test.sh ../src/UTILS/SD_frequency_characterize.spin2 -t 300
```

**Test Method:**
This utility dynamically changes the P2 sysclk frequency using `clkset()` to identify exactly where multi-block operations fail. It helps find timing-sensitive frequency ranges and quantization boundaries.

**Test Frequencies:**
- 320 MHz (baseline)
- 310 MHz, 305 MHz, 300 MHz
- 295 MHz, 290 MHz, 280 MHz, 270 MHz
- 260 MHz, 255 MHz, 250 MHz, 240 MHz
- 220 MHz, 200 MHz

At each frequency, the test performs:
1. `writeSectorsRaw(8)` - Write 8 sectors (4KB)
2. `readSectorsRaw(8)` - Read 8 sectors back
3. Data integrity verification

**Output Includes:**
- Half-period value at each frequency
- Pass/fail status for multi-block operations
- Data integrity verification results
- Identification of working vs failing frequencies

**Use Cases:**
- Determine safe sysclk frequencies for production
- Identify timing boundaries for streamer operations
- Debug frequency-related failures
- Validate driver timing across frequency ranges

### 6. SD_FAT32_audit.spin2

**Purpose:** Verify FAT32 filesystem integrity without modifying the card.

**Usage:**
```bash
./run_test.sh ../src/UTILS/SD_FAT32_audit.spin2 -t 60
```

**Read-Only:** This tool does NOT modify any data on the card.

**Checks Performed:**

| Structure | Validations |
|-----------|-------------|
| **MBR** | Boot signature, partition type, partition boundaries |
| **VBR** | Jump instruction, BPB fields, extended signature |
| **Backup VBR** | Matches primary VBR (sector 6) |
| **FSInfo** | All three signatures valid, free cluster count reasonable |
| **Backup FSInfo** | Matches primary FSInfo (sector 7) |
| **FAT Tables** | FAT1 and FAT2 match, media descriptor valid |
| **Root Directory** | Volume label present, structure valid |
| **Mount Test** | Driver can mount and read filesystem |

**Sample Output:**
```
==============================================

### 7. SD_FAT32_fsck.spin2

**Purpose:** Check and repair FAT32 filesystem corruption.

**Usage:**
```bash
./run_test.sh ../src/UTILS/SD_FAT32_fsck.spin2 -t 300
```

**WARNING:** This tool **modifies the card** to repair detected problems. Run the audit tool first if you want a read-only check.

**Four-Pass Architecture:**

| Pass | Name | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| **Pass 1** | Structural Integrity | Repair VBR backup, FSInfo signatures/backup, FAT[0]/[1]/[2] entries |
| **Pass 2** | Directory & Chain Validation | Walk directory tree, validate cluster chains, detect cross-links |
| **Pass 3** | Lost Cluster Recovery | Free allocated clusters not referenced by any file or directory |
| **Pass 4** | FAT Sync & Free Count | Synchronize FAT1 -> FAT2, correct FSInfo free cluster count |

**Repairs Performed:**

| Category | Repairs |
|----------|---------|
| **VBR** | Restore backup VBR from primary |
| **FSInfo** | Fix lead/struct/trail signatures, restore backup |
| **FAT entries** | Fix media type (FAT[0]), EOC marker (FAT[1]), root cluster (FAT[2]) |
| **Cluster chains** | Truncate chains with bad references |
| **Cross-links** | Detect clusters referenced by multiple chains |
| **Lost clusters** | Free allocated but unreferenced clusters |
| **FAT sync** | Copy FAT1 to FAT2 where sectors differ |
| **Free count** | Recalculate and update FSInfo free cluster count |

**Memory Requirements:**

The cluster bitmap uses 256KB (LONG[65536]) covering up to 2,097,152 clusters. This is sufficient for cards up to approximately 64GB. Cards with more clusters receive structural checks only (passes 1 and 4); passes 2 and 3 are skipped.

**Sample Output:**
```

## Recommended Workflow

### New Card Setup

1. **Characterize** - Read card registers to identify the card
   ```bash
   ./run_test.sh ../src/UTILS/SD_card_characterize.spin2 -t 60
   ```

2. **Speed Test** - Find maximum reliable SPI speed
   ```bash
   ./run_test.sh ../src/UTILS/SD_speed_characterize.spin2 -t 300
   ```

3. **Format** - Create clean FAT32 filesystem
   ```bash
   ./run_test.sh ../src/UTILS/SD_format_card.spin2 -t 120
   ```

4. **Audit** - Verify filesystem structure
   ```bash
   ./run_test.sh ../src/UTILS/SD_FAT32_audit.spin2 -t 60
   ```

5. **Benchmark** - Measure performance baseline
   ```bash
   ./run_test.sh ../src/UTILS/SD_performance_benchmark.spin2 -t 180
   ```

### After Testing

Run the audit tool to verify filesystem integrity:
```bash
./run_test.sh ../src/UTILS/SD_FAT32_audit.spin2 -t 60
```

If the audit reports failures, run FSCK to auto-repair:
```bash
./run_test.sh ../src/UTILS/SD_FAT32_fsck.spin2 -t 300
```

---

## Hardware Configuration

All utilities use the P2 Edge default pin configuration:

```spin2
CON
    SD_CS   = 60    ' Chip Select
    SD_MOSI = 59    ' Master Out Slave In
    SD_MISO = 58    ' Master In Slave Out
    SD_SCK  = 61    ' Serial Clock
```

Modify the `CON` section in each utility if using different pins.
