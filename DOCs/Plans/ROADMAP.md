# P2-uSD-Study Roadmap

Project roadmap for SD card driver development and testing.

---

## Driver Architecture

The project has a **single unified driver**: `src/SD_card_driver.spin2`

This driver includes all features from the original development phases:
- Smart pin SPI with hardware-accelerated CRC-16
- Streamer DMA for 512-byte sector transfers
- Multi-sector operations (CMD18/CMD25)
- Handle-based multi-file API (up to 4 simultaneous files)
- Worker cog with hardware lock serialization
- Per-cog current working directory
- Directory handle enumeration
- Conditional compilation (`SD_MINIMAL` for smaller builds)

---

## Completed Work

### Phase 0: Foundation
- [x] Download and study OB4269 FAT32 driver
- [x] Create technical reference documentation
- [x] Analyze FAT32 spec compliance
- [x] Document cross-OS portability issues
- [x] Create test card content structure
- [x] Add volumeLabel() method to driver

### Driver Fixes
- [x] Fix 1: FAT mirroring in deleteFile()
- [x] Fix 2: Preserve high 4 bits when freeing clusters
- [x] Fix 3: FSInfo sector support
- [x] Fix 4: Add unmount() method
- [x] Fix 5: Add sync() method

### Card Characterization
- [x] Create card catalog system
- [x] Characterize 6 SD cards with CID data
- [x] Document PNY card SPI timing issues
- [x] Create performance benchmark suite

### Phase 1: Smart Pin SPI (2026-01-29)
- [x] initSPIPins() - Configure P_TRANSITION, P_SYNC_TX, P_SYNC_RX
- [x] setSPISpeed() - Sysclk-independent frequency control
- [x] sp_transfer_8() - Smart pin byte transfer
- [x] Streamer DMA for 512-byte sector reads/writes

### Phase 2: Adaptive Timing (2026-01-29)
- [x] CID manufacturer identification (PNY, SanDisk, Samsung)
- [x] CSD TRAN_SPEED parsing for max speed
- [x] CSD timeout extraction (TAAC, NSAC, R2W_FACTOR)
- [x] Brand-specific speed limiting

### Phase 3: Multi-Sector Operations (2026-01-29)
- [x] readSectors() - CMD18 multi-block read
- [x] writeSectors() - CMD25 multi-block write
- [x] File API integration (do_read/do_write optimization)
- [x] Performance verified: ~4x speedup over single-sector

### Phase 4: Format Utility (2026-01-28)
- [x] FAT32 parameter calculations from card capacity
- [x] Write MBR, VBR, FSInfo, backup boot sector
- [x] Initialize FAT tables and root directory
- [x] FAT32 audit tool for read-only validation

### Phase 5: Multi-File Handle API (2026-01-30)
- [x] Handle table for up to 4 simultaneous file/directory handles
- [x] Single-writer policy enforcement
- [x] Per-handle independent file positions
- [x] Singleton architecture with DAT-based shared state
- [x] Worker cog pattern for serialized SPI access

### Phase 6: Driver Consolidation (2026-02-04)
- [x] Merged all driver variants into single `SD_card_driver.spin2`
- [x] Single `regression-tests/` directory for all tests
- [x] Conditional compilation: `SD_MINIMAL`, `SD_INCLUDE_RAW`, `SD_INCLUDE_REGISTERS`, `SD_INCLUDE_SPEED`
- [x] Feature matrix documented for minimal vs full builds

### Phase 7: Per-Cog CWD & Directory Handles (2026-02-07)
- [x] Per-cog current working directory (`cog_dir_sec[8]`)
- [x] `openDirectory()`, `readDirectoryHandle()`, `closeDirectoryHandle()` API
- [x] Directory handles share existing unified handle pool (no new arrays)
- [x] Handle type guards (file ops reject directory handles and vice versa)
- [x] searchDirectory() refactored to use local variable, no global side effects

### Phase 8: FSCK Utility (2026-02-05)
- [x] 4-pass filesystem check and repair (`SD_FAT32_fsck.spin2`)
- [x] Pass 1: Structural validation (MBR, VBR, FSInfo, FAT headers)
- [x] Pass 2: Directory scan with cross-reference bitmap
- [x] Pass 3: Unreferenced cluster detection and free
- [x] Pass 4: FAT sync (FAT2 = FAT1) and free count recalculation
- [x] 256KB cluster bitmap supports cards up to 64GB

### Phase 9: Demo Shell (2026-02-07)
- [x] Interactive terminal shell with command parser
- [x] Navigation: mount, dir, cd, pwd, mkdir, rmdir
- [x] File ops: type, hexdump, copy, rename, delete, touch
- [x] Diagnostics: audit, fsck, benchmark
- [x] Card info: stats, card, version
- [x] Handle-based directory enumeration

### Phase 10: Bug Fixes & Error Handling (2026-02-07)
- [x] Pre-mount operations now return `E_NOT_MOUNTED` (was returning stale 0)
- [x] `changeDirectory()` correctly rejects files (returns `E_NOT_A_DIR`)
- [x] Regression test coverage: 151+ tests across 6 test suites

- [ ] Boundary conditions (0-byte files, exact sector sizes, deep nesting)
- [ ] CRC error injection via test hooks
- [ ] Recovery scenarios after errors
- [ ] Directory handle error paths

### Documentation & Release Preparation
**Status**: In Progress

- [x] README.md with API overview and examples
- [x] Driver Tutorial with practical examples
- [x] Regression Testing documentation
- [x] Card Catalog with performance data
- [x] Utilities Guide
- [ ] Error Code Reference: All E_* codes with descriptions
