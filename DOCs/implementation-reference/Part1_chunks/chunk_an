6.4 Power Scheme
The power scheme of the SD Memory Card bus is handled locally in each SD Memory Card and in the
host.

6.4.1 Power Up Sequence for SD Bus Interface

The maximum of
1 msec, 74 clock cycles
and supply ramp up time

Figure 6-4 : Power-up Diagram of Card
'Power up time' is defined as voltage rising time from 0 volt to VDD min (refer to Section 6.6) and depends
on application parameters such as the maximum number of SD Cards, the bus length and the
characteristic of the power supply unit.
'Supply ramp up time' provides the time that the power is built up to the operating level (Host Supply
Voltage) and the time to wait until the SD card can accept the first command,
The host shall supply power to the card so that the voltage is reached to Vdd_min within 250ms and start
to supply at least 74 SD clocks to the SD card with keeping CMD line to high. In case of SPI mode, CS
shall be held to high during 74 clock cycles.
After power up (including hot insertion, i.e. inserting a card when the bus is operating) the SD Card enters
the idle state. In case of SD host, CMD0 is not necessary. In case of SPI host, CMD0 shall be the first
command to send the card to SPI mode.
CMD8 is newly added in the Physical Layer Specification Version 2.00 to support multiple voltage ranges
and used to check whether the card supports supplied voltage. The version 2.00 or later host shall issue
CMD8 and verify voltage before card initialization. The host that does not support CMD8 shall supply high
voltage range.
ACMD41 is a synchronization command used to negotiate the operation voltage range and to poll the
cards until they are out of their power-up sequence. In case the host system connects multiple cards, the
host shall check that all cards satisfy the supplied voltage. Otherwise, the host should select one of the
cards and initialize.

Reset level is not described in Figure 6-4 of the Physical Layer Specification Version 2.00. Change of
Figure 6-5 is applied to Figure 6-4 of the Physical Layer Specification.

6.4.1.3 Power On or Power Cycle
Followings are requirements for Power on and Power cycle to assure a reliable SD Card hard reset.
(1) Voltage level shall be below 0.5V
(2) Duration shall be at least 1ms.
6.4.1.4 Power Supply Ramp Up
The power ramp up time is defined from 0.5V threshold level up to the operating supply voltage which is
stable between VDD(min.) and VDD(max.) and host can supply SDCLK.
Followings are recommendation of Power ramp up:
(1) Voltage of power ramp up should be monotonic as much as possible.
(2) The minimum ramp up time should be 0.1ms.
(3) The maximum ramp up time should be 35ms for 2.7-3.6V power supply.
(4) Host shall wait until VDD is stable.
(5) After 1ms VDD stable time, host provides at least 74 clocks before issuing the first command.

6.4.1.5 Power Down and Power Cycle
When the host shuts down the power, the card VDD shall be lowered to less than 0.5Volt for a minimum
period of 1ms. During power down, DAT, CMD, and CLK should be disconnected or driven to logical 0 by
the host to avoid a situation that the operating current is drawn through the signal lines.
If the host needs to change the operating voltage, a power cycle is required. Power cycle means the
power is turned off and supplied again. Power cycle is also needed for accessing cards that are already
in Inactive State. To create a power cycle the host shall follow the power down description before power
up the card (i.e. the card VDD shall be once lowered to less than 0.5Volt for a minimum period of 1ms).

7. SPI Mode
7.1 Introduction
The SPI mode consists of a secondary communication protocol that is offered by Flash-based SD Memory
Cards. This mode is a subset of the SD Memory Card protocol, designed to communicate with a SPI
channel, found in some microcontrollers. The interface is selected during the first reset command after
power up (CMD0) and cannot be changed once the part is powered on.
The SPI standard defines the physical link only, and not the complete data transfer protocol. The SD
Memory Card SPI implementation uses a subset of the SD Memory Card protocol and command set. The
advantage of the SPI mode is the capability of using an off-the-shelf host, hence reducing the design-in
effort to minimum. The disadvantage is the loss of performance of the SPI mode versus SD mode (e.g.
Single data line and hardware CS signal per card).
The commands and functions in SD mode defined after the Version 2.00 are not supported in SPI
mode. The card may respond to the commands and functions even if the card is in SPI mode but
host should not use them in SPI mode.
SPI Mode is not supported by SDUC cards.

7.2 SPI Bus Protocol
While the SD Memory Card channel is based on command and data bit streams that are initiated by a
start bit and terminated by a stop bit, the SPI channel is byte oriented. Every command or data block is
built of 8-bit bytes and is byte aligned with the CS signal (i.e. the length is a multiple of 8 clock cycles).
The card starts to count SPI bus clock cycle at the assertion of the CS signal. Every command or data
token shall be aligned with 8-clock cycle boundary.
Similar to the SD Memory Card protocol, the SPI messages consist of command, response and datablock tokens. All communication between host and cards is controlled by the host (master). The host
starts every bus transaction by asserting the CS signal low.
The selected card always responds to the command as opposed to the SD mode.
When the card encounters a data retrieval problem in a read operation, it will respond with an error
response (which replaces the expected data block) rather than by a timeout as in the SD mode.
Additionally, every data block sent to the card during write operations will be responded with a data
response token.
In the case of a Standard Capacity Memory Card, a data block can be as big as one card write block and
as small as a single byte. Partial block read/write operations are enabled by card options specified in the
CSD register.
In case of SDHC and SDXC Cards, block length is fixed to 512 bytes. The block length set by CMD16 is
only used for CMD42 and not used for memory data transfer. So, partial block read/write operations are
also disabled. Furthermore, Write Protected commands (CMD28, CMD29 and CMD30) are not supported.

firstly initialized by using CMD0 and ACMD41. In any of the cases CMD1 is not recommended because it may be difficult for the host
to distinguish between MultiMediaCard and SD Memory Card.
If the SD card is initialized by CMD1 and the host treat it as MMC card, not SD card, the Data of the card may be damaged because of
wrong interpretation of CSD and CID registers.
(*3) Note: SDUC card, card can stay at busy status and does not reply ready to host during ACMD41 to let host know SDUC card cannot use SPI
mode.

Figure 7-1 : SD Memory Card State Diagram (SPI mode)

7.2.1 Mode Selection and Initialization
The SD Card is powered up in the SD mode. It will enter SPI mode if the CS signal is asserted (negative)
during the reception of the reset command (CMD0). If the card recognizes that the SD mode is required
it will not respond to the command and remain in the SD mode. If SPI mode is required, the card will
switch to SPI and respond with the SPI mode R1 response.
The only way to return to the SD mode is by entering the power cycle. In SPI mode, the SD Card protocol
state machine in SD mode is not observed. All the SD Card commands supported in SPI mode are always
available.
Figure 7-2 shows the initialization sequence of SPI mode.
SEND_IF_COND (CMD8) is used to verify SD Memory Card interface operating condition. The argument
format of CMD8 is the same as defined in SD mode and the response format of CMD8 is defined in
Section 7.3.2.6. The card checks the validity of operating condition by analyzing the argument of CMD8
and the host checks the validity by analyzing the response of CMD8. The supplied voltage is indicated by
VHS field in the argument. The card assumes the voltage specified in VHS as the current supplied voltage.
Only 1-bit of VHS shall be set to 1 at any given time. Check pattern is used for the host to check validity
of communication between the host and the card.
If the card indicates an illegal command, the card is legacy and does not support CMD8. If the card
supports CMD8 and can operate on the supplied voltage, the response echoes back the supply voltage
and the check pattern that were set in the command argument.
If VCA in the response is set to 0, the card cannot operate on the supplied voltage. If check pattern is not
287

©Copyright 2001-2023 KIOXIA, Panasonic Connect, SanDisk and SD Card Association

matched, CMD8 communication is not valid. In this case, it is recommended to retry CMD8 sequence.

Figure 7-2 : SPI Mode Initialization Flow
READ_OCR (CMD58) is designed to provide SD Memory Card hosts with a mechanism to identify cards
that do not match the VDD range desired by the host. If the host does not accept voltage range, it shall not
proceed with further initialization sequence. The levels in the OCR register shall be defined accordingly
(See Section 5.1).
SD_SEND_OP_COND (ACMD41) is used to start initialization and to check if the card has completed
initialization. It is mandatory to issue CMD8 prior to the first ACMD41. Receiving of CMD8 expands the
CMD58 and ACMD41 function; HCS (High Capacity Support) in the argument of ACMD41 and CCS (Card
Capacity Status) in the response of CMD58. HCS is ignored by the card, which didn't accept CMD8.
Standard Capacity SD Memory Card ignores HCS. The "in idle state" bit in the R1 response of ACMD41
is used by the card to inform the host if initialization of ACMD41 is completed. Setting this bit to "1"
indicates that the card is still initializing. Setting this bit to "0" indicates completion of initialization. The
host repeatedly issues ACMD41 until this bit is set to "0". The card checks the HCS bit in the OCR only
at the first ACMD41. While repeating ACMD41, the host shall not issue another command except CMD0.
For SDUC card, card may indicate that the card is still initializing in the R3 response of ACMD41
continuously to let host know SDUC card cannot use SPI mode.
After initialization is completed, the host should get CCS information in the response of CMD58. CCS is
288

©Copyright 2001-2023 KIOXIA, Panasonic Connect, SanDisk and SD Card Association
Physical Layer Simplified Specification Version 9.10
valid when the card accepted CMD8 and after the completion of initialization. CCS=0 means that the card
is SDSC. CCS=1 means that the card is SDHC or SDXC.

7.2.2 Bus Transfer Protection
Every SD Card command transferred on the bus is protected by CRC bits. In SPI mode, the SD Memory
Card offers a CRC ON mode which enables systems built with reliable data links to exclude the hardware
or firmware required for implementing the CRC generation and verification functions.
In the CRC OFF mode, the CRC bits of the command are defined as 'don't care' for the transmitter and
ignored by the receiver.
The SPI interface is initialized in the CRC OFF mode in default. However, the RESET command (CMD0)
that is used to switch the card to SPI mode, is received by the card while in SD mode and, therefore, shall
have a valid CRC field.
Since CMD0 has no arguments, the content of all the fields, including the CRC field, are constants and
need not be calculated in run time. A valid reset command is:
0x40, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x95
After the card is put into SPI mode, CRC check for all commands including CMD0 will be done according
to CMD59 setting.
The host can turn the CRC option on and off using the CRC_ON_OFF command (CMD59). Host should
enable CRC verification before issuing ACMD41.
The CMD8 CRC verification is always enabled. The Host shall set correct CRC in the argument of CMD8.
If CRC error is detected, card returns CRC error in R1 response regardless of command index.

7.2.3 Data Read
The SPI mode supports single block read and Multiple Block read operations (CMD17 or CMD18 in the
SD Memory Card protocol). Upon reception of a valid read command the card will respond with a
response token followed by a data token (Refer to Figure 7-3). In case of Standard Capacity Card, the
size in the data token is determined by the block length set by SET_BLOCKLEN (CMD16). In case of
SDHC and SDXC Cards, block length is fixed to 512 Bytes regardless of the block length set by CMD16.

Figure 7-3 : Single Block Read Operation
A valid data block is suffixed with a 16-bit CRC generated by the standard CCITT polynomial x16+x12+x5+1.
The maximum block length is given by 512 Bytes regardless of READ_BL_LEN, defined in the CSD. If
partial block access is enabled in Standard Capacity Card (i.e. the CSD parameter READ_BL_PARTIAL
equals 1), the block length can be any number between 1 and 512 Bytes. The start address can be any
byte address in the valid address range of the card. Every block, however, shall be contained in a single
physical card sector.
If partial block access is disabled, only 512-Byte data length is supported.
SDHC and SDXC Cards only support 512-byte block length. The start address shall be aligned with the
block boundary.
In the case of a data retrieval error, the card will not transmit any data. Instead, a special data error token
will be sent to the host. Figure 7-4 shows a data read operation that terminated with an error token rather
than a data block.

7.2.4 Data Write
The SPI mode supports single block and multiple block write commands. Upon reception of a valid write
command (CMD24 or CMD25 in the SD Memory Card protocol), the card will respond with a response
token and will wait for a data block to be sent from the host. CRC suffix, block length and start address
restrictions are (with the exception of the CSD parameter WRITE_BL_PARTIAL controlling the partial
block write option and WRITE_BL_LEN) identical to the read operation (Refer to Figure 7-6).

Figure 7-6 : Single Block Write Operation
Every data block has a prefix of 'Start Block' token (one byte).
After a data block has been received, the card will respond with a data-response token. If the data block
has been received without errors, it will be programmed. As long as the card is busy programming, a
continuous stream of busy tokens will be sent to the host (effectively holding the DataOut line low).
Once the programming operation is completed, the host should check the results of the programming
using the SEND_STATUS command (CMD13). Some errors (e.g. address out of range, write protect
violation etc.) are detected during programming only. The only validation check performed on the data
block, and communicated to the host via the data-response token, is the CRC and general Write Error
indication.
In a Multiple Block write operation, the stop transmission will be done by sending 'Stop Tran' token instead
of 'Start Block' token at the beginning of the next block. In case of Write Error indication (on the data

response) the host shall use SEND_NUM_WR_BLOCKS (ACMD22) in order to get the number of well
written write blocks. The data tokens description is given in Section 7.3.3.2.

Figure 7-7 : Multiple Block Write Operation
While the card is busy, resetting the CS signal will not terminate the programming process. The card will
release the DataOut line (tri-state) and continue with programming. If the card is reselected before the
programming is finished, the DataOut line will be forced back to low and all commands will be rejected.
Resetting a card (using CMD0 for SD memory card) will terminate any pending or active programming
operation. This may destroy the data formats on the card. It is in the responsibility of the host to prevent
this for occurring.

7.2.5 Erase & Write Protect Management
The erase and write protect management procedures in the SPI mode are identical to those of the SD
mode. While the card is erasing or changing the write protection bits of the predefined sector list, it will
be in a busy state and hold the DataOut line low. Figure 7-8 illustrates a 'no data' bus transaction with
and without busy signaling.

Physical Layer Simplified Specification Version 9.10

7.2.6 Read CID/CSD Registers
Unlike the SD Memory Card protocol (where the register contents is sent as a command response),
reading the contents of the CSD and CID registers in SPI mode is a simple read-block transaction. The
card will respond with a standard response token (Refer to Figure 7-3) followed by a data block of 16
bytes suffixed with a 16-bit CRC.
The data timeout for the CSD command cannot be set to the cards TAAC since this value is stored in the
card's CSD. Therefore, the standard response timeout value (NCR) is used for read latency of the CSD
register.

7.2.7 Reset Sequence
The SD Memory Card requires a defined reset sequence. The card enters an idle state after power on
reset or reset command (CMD0 for SD memory card). In this state, the only valid host commands are
CMD8 (SEND_IF_COND), ACMD41 (SD_SEND_OP_COND), CMD58 (READ_OCR) and CMD59
(CRC_ON_OFF).
For the Thick (2.1 mm) SD Memory Card - CMD1 (SEND_OP_COND) is also valid - this means that in
SPI mode, CMD1 and ACMD41 have the same behaviors, but the usage of ACMD41 is preferable since
it allows easy distinction between an SD Memory Card and a MultiMediaCard. For the Thin (1.4 mm)
Standard Size SD Memory Card, CMD1 (SEND_OP_COND) is an illegal command during the
initialization that is done after power on. After Power On, once the card has accepted valid
ACMD41, it will be able to also accept CMD1 even if used after re-initializing (CMD0) the card. It
was defined in such way in order to be able to distinguish between a Thin SD Memory Card and a
MultiMediaCard (that supports CMD1 as well).

7.2.8 Error Conditions
Unlike the SD Memory Card protocol, in the SPI mode, the card will always respond to a command. The
response indicates acceptance or rejection of the command. A command may be rejected in any one of
the following cases:
- It is sent while the card is in read operation (except CMD12 which is legal).
- It is sent while the card is in Busy.
- Card is locked and it is other than Class 0 or 7 commands.
- It is not supported (illegal opcode).
- CRC check failed.
- It contains an illegal operand.
- It was out of sequence during an erase sequence.
Note that in case the host sends command while the card sends data in read operation then the response
with an illegal command indication may disturb the data transfer.

7.2.9 Memory Array Partitioning
Same as SD mode.

7.2.10 Card Lock/Unlock
Usage of card lock and unlock commands in SPI mode is identical to SD mode. In both cases, the
command is responded to with an R1b response type. After the busy signal clears, the host should obtain
the result of the operation by issuing a SEND_STATUS command (CMD13). Refer to Section 4.3.7 for
details.

7.2.11 Application Specific Commands
Identical to SD mode with the exception of the APP_CMD status bit (Refer to Table 4-42), which is not
available in SPI.

292

Physical Layer Simplified Specification Version 9.10

7.2.12 Content Protection Command
All the special Content Protection ACMDs and security functionality related to the CPRM is the same as
SD mode.

7.2.13 Switch Function Command
Same as for SD mode with two exceptions:
 The command is valid under the "not idle state".
 The switching period is within 8 clocks after the end bit of the R1 response of CMD0.

7.2.14 High Speed Mode
Same as SD mode.

7.2.15 Speed Class Specification
As opposed to SD mode, the card cannot guarantee its Speed Class. In SPI mode, host shall treat the
card as Class 0 no matter what Class is indicated in SD Status.

7.2.16 Boot Functionalities
Boot functionalities including Fast Boot are not supported in SPI mode.

7.2.17 TCG Security
When TCG is enabled, host can read data from TCG MBR Table by SPI mode before pre-boot
authentication. However, since host cannot execute pre-boot authentication over SPI-mode, host cannot
access the User Area properly in this mode.

7.2.18 RPMB
Host cannot access to RPMB Unit and execute RPMB authentication in SPI mode.

7.3.1 Command Tokens
7.3.1.1 Command Format
All the SD Memory Card commands are 6 bytes long. The command transmission always starts with the

7.3.1.2 Command Classes
As in SD mode, the SPI commands are divided into several classes (See Table 7-2). Each class supports
a set of card functions. A SD Memory Card will support the same set of optional command classes in both
communication modes (there is only one command class table in the CSD register). The available
command classes, and the supported command for a specific class, however, are different in the SD
Memory Card and the SPI communication mode.
Note that except for the classes that are not supported in SPI mode (class 1, 3 and 9), the mandatory
required classes for the SD mode are the same for the SPI mode.
CMD58/59 in SD mode are different from those in SPI mode.
