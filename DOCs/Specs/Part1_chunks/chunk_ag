4.7.5 Difference of SD Commands Definition in UHS-II
Table 4-34 shows the difference of SD commands definition when the card is in UHS-II mode.
SD-TRAN driver of host should manage the difference of SD commands functions. Not supported
commands should not issue to UHS-II card. CMD13 shall not be issued during data transfer. Normally,
data transfer should be stopped by setting TLEN instead of using CMD12. CMD23 and CMD55 functions
are included in UHS-II packet functions.

Illegal

(1) Not Affected means that the command is not executed in any card state, and response is returned
(response type is up to implementation).
(2) Illegal means that card returns response with NACK=1.
(3) As SDHC/SDXC/SDUC Cards do not support CMD28, 29 and 30, these commands are also illegal in
UHS-II mode.

Physical Layer Simplified Specification Version 9.10

4.9 Responses
All responses are sent via the command line CMD. The response transmission always starts with the left
bit of the bit string corresponding to the response codeword. The code length depends on the response
type.
A response always starts with a start bit (always 0), followed by the bit indicating the direction of
transmission (card = 0). A value denoted by 'x' in the tables below indicates a variable entry. All responses
except the type R3 (see below) are protected by a CRC (see Section 4.5 for the definition of CRC7).
Every command codeword is terminated by the end bit (always 1).
There are five types of responses for the SD Memory Card. The SDIO Card supports additional response
types named R4 and R5. Refer to SDIO Card Spec for detailed information on the SDIO commands and
responses. Their formats are defined as follows:

4.9.1 R1 (normal response command):
Code length is 48 bits. The bits 45:40 indicate the index of the command to be responded to, this value
being interpreted as a binary coded number (between 0 and 63). The status of the card is coded in 32
bits. Note that if a data transfer to the card is involved, then a busy signal may appear on the data line
after the transmission of each block of data. The host shall check for busy after data block transmission.
The card status is described in Section 4.10.

4.9.2 R1b
R1b is identical to R1 with an optional busy signal transmitted on the data line. The card may become
busy after receiving these commands based on its state prior to the command reception. The Host shall
check for busy at the response. Refer to Section 4.12.3 for a detailed description and timing diagrams.

4.9.3 R2 (CID, CSD register)
Code length is 136 bits. The contents of the CID register are sent as a response to the commands CMD2
and CMD10. The contents of the CSD register are sent as a response to CMD9. Only the bits [127...1] of
the CID and CSD are transferred, the reserved bit [0] of these registers is replaced by the end bit of the
response.

it will be '000011' (together with bit 5 in the status bits it means = CMD3). The 16 MSB bits of the argument

4.9.6 R7 (Card interface condition)
Code length is 48 bits. The card supported voltage information of 3.3V range power pin is sent by the
response of CMD8. Bits 19-16 indicate the voltage range that the card supports. The card that accepted
the supplied voltage returns R7 response. In the response, the card echoes back both the voltage range
and check pattern set in the argument.

4.10 Three Status Information of SD Memory Card
The SD Memory Card supports three status fields as follows:
- 'Card Status': Error and state information of a executed command, indicated in the response
- 'SD Status': Extended status field of 512 bits that supports special features of the SD Memory Card and
future Application-Specific features.
-’Task Status’. Status information of queued tasks in CQ mode (Refer to Section 0), indicated in the
response. CMD13 R1 indicates either Card Status or Task Status by selecting b[15] of CMD13 argument.
R1 of the other commands indicates only Card Status.

4.10.1 Card Status
The response format R1 shall contain a 32-bit field named card status as a response to CMD13 with
argument b[15]=’0’. This field is intended to transmit the card's status information (which may be stored
in a local status register) to the host. If not specified otherwise, the status entries are always related to
the previous issued command.
Table 4-42 defines the different entries of the status. Unused reserved bits shall be set to 0. The type and
clear condition fields in the table are abbreviated as follows:
 Type:
•E: Error bit.
•S: Status bit.
•R: Detected and set for the actual command response.
•X: Detected and set during command execution. The host can get the status by issuing a command
with R1 response.
 Clear Condition:
•A: According to the card current status.
•B: Always related to the previous command. Reception of a valid command will clear it (with a delay
of one command).
•C: Clear by read.
