Description

1) S: power supply; I: input; O: output using push-pull drivers; PP: I/O using push-pull drivers;
2) The extended DAT lines (DAT1-DAT3) are input on power up. They start to operate as DAT lines after SET_BUS_WIDTH
command. The Host shall keep its own DAT1-DAT3 lines in input mode, as well, while they are not used.
3) At power up this line has a 50KOhm pull up enabled in the card. This resistor serves two functions Card detection and
Mode Selection. For Mode Selection, the host can drive the line high or let it be pulled high to select SD mode. If the host
wants to select SPI mode it should drive the line low. For Card detection, the host detects that the line is pulled high. This
pull-up should be disconnected by the user, during regular data transfer, with SET_CLR_CARD_DETECT (ACMD42)
command
4) DAT1 line may be used as Interrupt Output (from the Card) in SDIO mode during all the times that it is not in use for data
transfer operations (refer to "SDIO Card Specification" for further details).
5) DAT2 line may be used as Read Wait signal in SDIO mode (refer to "SDIO Card Specification" for further details).

UHS-II Card shall not drive unused lines of SD I/F in UHS-II mode. (CLK, CMD and DAT[3:2]. DAT[2]
may be used as interrupt line in case of UHS-II SDIO Card. In this case, card controls DAT[2] level.)
Host shall not leave these unused lines floating, but keep them at a defined high or low level. How to keep
line level is dependent on host implementation. For example, use pull-up resistor or host drives the lines
to low level without providing pull-up voltage. As DAT[1:0] are used for providing RCLK, individual line
control is required to use pull-up method for CMD and DAT[3:2]. CLK (without pull-up resistor) should be
driven to low.
In case of entering hibernate mode, unused lines shall be set to low before turning off VDD1.

Host may use SDR50, DDR50 and SDR104 modes with either UHS50 Card or UHS104 Card.
Table 3-5 shows usable UHS performance depends on the combination of host and card. UHS-I for
removable card is presumed that one card is connected to a SD bus. Maximum performance of up to
104MB/s is possible only if host supports SDR104 mode and card is UHS104 Card (supports SDR104
mode). If card is a UHS50 Card or if host doesn't support SDR104 mode, performance is limited to 50MB/s
(SDR104 mode cannot be used).
Host may use DDR50 mode with UHS50 Card and UHS104 Card in microSD form factors.

3.9.4 UHS-I Bus Speed Modes Selection Sequence
Power on

CMD0
CMD8

Once signal voltage is switched to 1.8V, the card continues 1.8V signaling
regardless of CMD0. Power cycle resets the signal voltage to 3.3V.
After Switching 1.8V singling, the card cannot be changed to SPI mode.

Host requests card to change 1.8V signal voltage by ACMD41.
A status is indicated in the response whether voltage switch is accepted.

ACMD41
CMD11

If voltage switch is accepted by ACMD41, CMD11 invokes voltage switching
sequence. If it is completed, the card enters SDR12 (default).

CMD2
CMD3
CMD7

If the CARD_IS_LOCKED status is set to 1 in the response of CMD7,
CMD42 is required before ACMD6 to unlock the card.

CMD42
UHS-I supports only 4-bit mode. Host shall select 4-bit mode by ACMD6.

ACMD6
CMD6
CMD19

Driver Strength is selected by CMD6 Function Group 3.
Bus Speed Mode is selected by CMD6 Function Group 1.
Current Limit is selected by CMD6 Function Group 4.

CMD19 sends a tuning block to the host to determine sampling point.
UHS50 and UHS104 cards support CMD19 in 1.8V signaling. Sampling clock
tuning is required for UHS104 host and optional for UHS50 host.

Figure 3-16 : Command Sequence to Use UHS-I
Figure 3-16 shows command sequence to use a UHS-I. After power cycle, card is in 3.3V signaling mode.
The first CMD0 selects the bus mode; SD mode or SPI mode. 1.8V signaling mode can be entered only
in SD mode. Once the card enters 1.8V signaling mode, the card cannot be switched to SPI mode or 3.3V
signaling without power cycle. If the card receives CMD0, card returns to Idle state but still work with
SDR12 timing. UHS-I is provided in SD mode but not in SPI mode.
As higher bus speed requires low level signaling, UHS-I adopts 1.8V signaling level for SDR50, DDR50
and SDR104 modes. Still card is supplied with 3.3V by the host and 1.8V signaling level for SDCLK, CMD
and DAT[3:0] lines is converted from 3.3V power line. To avoid voltage mismatch between host and card,
signaling level is changed by voltage switch sequence at the initialization. The host and card communicate
using ACMD41 whether host and card support 1.8V signaling mode. Support of 1.8V signaling both host
and card means UHS-I can be used. CMD11 invokes the voltage switch sequence. The card enters UHSI mode and card input and output timings are changed (SDR12 in default) when the voltage switch
sequence is completed successfully. (Refer to Section 4.2.4 for more detail.)
Only 4-bit bus mode is supported in UHS-I except CMD42. If the card is locked, host needs to unlock the
card by CMD42 in 1-bit mode and then needs to issue ACMD6 to change 4-bit bus mode. Operating in
1-bit mode is not assured.
Host can choose suitable output driver strength by CMD6 Function Group 3.
Host can choose one of UHS-I modes by CMD6 Function Group 1. Each UHS-I mode is specified by the
maximum frequency, sampling edges (rising-only or both) and maximum Power consumption for
compatibility with existing cards. Host can choose one of UHS-I mode depending on capability of
generating SDCLK frequency and capacity of power supply host supported.
22

©Copyright 2001-2023 KIOXIA, Panasonic Connect, SanDisk and SD Card Association
Physical Layer Simplified Specification Version 9.10
CMD19 can be executed in transfer state of 1.8V signaling mode while the card is unlocked. The other
case, CMD19 is treated as illegal command.

3.9.5 UHS-I System Block Diagram
Figure 3-17 shows a typical UHS-I host system that supports removable cards. Host has clock generator
which supplies SDCLK to the card. In case of write operation, as clock direction and data direction is the
same, write data can be transferred synchronized with SDCLK regardless of transmission line delay. In
case of read operation, as clock direction and data direction is opposite, read data host received is
delayed by round-trip delay, output delay and latency of host and card. So receiving data is the most
critical for the host. Therefore, host needs to have sampling clock generator to receive response, CRC
status and read data block.

3.9.5.1 Variable Sampling Host
The host use variable sampling clock generator to determine correct sampling point. The host can use
predefine tuning block stored in card as an aid for finding sampling operating point. The host can use
CMD19 tuning command to read tuning block.
This method is applied to the whole frequency range. In lower frequency less than 25MHz, host needs to
access the card without tuning.
3.9.5.2 Fixed Sampling Host
The host uses pre-determined sampling point. This method is available in up to 100MHz. HOST-SDR-FD
can make sampling clock by using clock loopback method (Implementation examples of HOST-SDR-FD
are shown in 0). UHS50 and UHS104 card shall be compliant to tODLY (max.) output delay constraint for
less than 100MHz frequency range.

3.10.4 UHS-II Interface Selection Sequence
UHS-II supported host shall support Legacy SD Bus Interface (I/F) and UHS-II I/F. Removable UHS-II
card slot shall be connected to both I/Fs. Then UHS-II card may be initialized not only in UHS-II mode but
also in SD Bus I/F mode.
Figure 3-19 shows how to select UHS-II mode. After power up, SD bus I/F and UHS-II I/F of UHS-II card
are enabled. UHS-II supported host provides RCLK and STB.L to D0 lane. Host waits D1 lane to change
EIDL to STB.L. If STB.L is detected on D1 lane, host starts UHS-II initialization. If D1 lane is not changed
to STB.L by 200us timeout, host should initialize the card in SD Bus I/F mode. As 200us for STB.L
detection is defined as per card, host needs to determine total timeout value that depends on UHS-II bus
topology of a system.

step is Device Initialization. Backend functions of devices are initialized. The third step is Enumeration. 4-bit
unique Device ID is assigned to each device to be able to select one of devices by a Device ID. The fourth
step is Configuration. UHS-II register is set to be able to use UHS-II devices in optimized bus sequence. The
fifth step is SD-TRAN Initialization. UHS-II emulates SD Commands by the SD-TRAN. SD-TRAN Initialization
is equivalent to SD Bus Initialization but host issues SD Commands in UHS-II packets. UHS-II card accepts
most SD commands except some specific commands. Refer to Section 4.7.5 about the difference of SD
command definition in UHS-II. If CMD0 is received, the UHS-II card re-starts from SD-TRAN initialization.
Figure 3-21 shows SD Bus I/F Initialization sequence for UHS-II Card. UHS-II card shall disable UHS-II
Interface before execution of ACMD41 is completed. If VDD2 is provided during SD Interface initialization of
UHS-II Card, host shall continue to provide VDD2. VDD2 may be off by power cycle with VDD1 before starting
SD Interface initialization. On detecting non UHS-II card, host may turn off VDD2 anytime.
