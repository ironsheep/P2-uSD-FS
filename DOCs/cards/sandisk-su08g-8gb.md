### Filesystem (Corrupt FAT32)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| MBR Partition Type | $0C (FAT32 LBA) |
| VBR Sector | 2,048 |
| OEM Name | mkdosfs (Linux formatter residue) |
| Status | **CORRUPT** - VBR fields contain garbage |

**Note:** Card was formatted with Linux `mkdosfs` but filesystem is corrupt. Needs FAT32 reformatting before use.

### Test Results

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Card Init | PASS | CMD0/CMD8/ACMD41 sequence successful |
| CID Read | PASS | Worker cog routing |
| CSD Read | PASS | Worker cog routing |
| SCR Read | PASS | Worker cog routing |
| OCR Read | PASS | Cached during init |
| MBR Read | PASS | FAT32 LBA ($0C) partition |
| VBR Read | PASS | But data is corrupt |
| Mount | N/A | Needs FAT32 reformat first |

### Notes

- **First "Chinese" card** - See also "Chinese Made" #2 (MID $1B, genuine Samsung)
- **Unlabeled card** with speed class 4 marking, Chinese text
- CID claims **SanDisk** (MID $03, OEM "SD") - suspicious for no-name card
- Possible scenarios:
  1. Genuine SanDisk card that was relabeled/repackaged
  2. Counterfeit card spoofing SanDisk's MID (common with fakes)
  3. Recycled/refurbished SanDisk flash with new controller
- **Very old** - manufactured October 2010 (15+ years old)
- **COPY=1** - Card marked as a copy (not original)
- **SD 3.0x spec** compliant (SD_SPEC3=1, but SD_SPEC4=0)
- Filesystem corrupt - needs FAT32 reformatting before use
- **(4)** = Speed Class 4 (4 MB/s minimum write speed) - slowest class
- DATA_STAT_AFTER_ERASE=0 (erased data reads as 0s)
