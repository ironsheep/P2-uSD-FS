### Notes

- **Genuine Samsung inside** - MID $1B + OID "SM" confirms authentic Samsung flash
- **Second "Chinese" card** - See also "Chinese Made" 8GB (MID $03, claims SanDisk)
- **OEM/Generic card** - Product name "00000" suggests internal/OEM variant without retail naming
- Unlabeled physical card - Chinese text, no brand markings visible
- **SDHC** - High Capacity (8GB class, ~7GB usable)
- **SD 3.0x spec** compliant (SD_SPEC3=1, but SD_SPEC4=0)
- **COPY=0** - Original card (not a copy)
- Manufactured August 2014 (older card)
- Partition type $0E is unusual - may be FAT16 LBA or custom partition scheme
- Samsung recommended for embedded SPI use (major manufacturer)
- DATA_STAT_AFTER_ERASE=0 (erased data reads as 0s)
