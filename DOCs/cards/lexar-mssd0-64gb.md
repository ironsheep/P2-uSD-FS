### Filesystem (Factory - exFAT)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| MBR Partition Type | $07 (exFAT/NTFS) |
| Factory Format | exFAT (default for 64GB+) |

**Note:** Card ships with exFAT filesystem. Needs FAT32 format for P2 SD driver compatibility.

### Test Results

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Card Init | PASS | CMD0/CMD8/ACMD41 sequence successful |
| CID Read | PASS | Worker cog routing |
| CSD Read | PASS | Worker cog routing |
| SCR Read | PASS | Worker cog routing |
| OCR Read | PASS | Cached during init |
| MBR Read | PASS | exFAT partition detected |
| Mount | N/A | Requires FAT32 format first |

### Notes

- **Lexar-branded** card using Longsys silicon (Longsys acquired Lexar brand in 2017)
- MID $AD = Longsys (often incorrectly listed as Hynix in older databases)
- OEM code "LS" = Longsys/Lexar
- **CCC $DB7** includes Class 1 (stream read) and Class 11 (video speed class) - video-optimized card
- **V30** = Video Speed Class 30 (30 MB/s sustained write)
- **U3** = UHS Speed Class 3 (30 MB/s minimum write)
- **(10)** = Speed Class 10 (10 MB/s minimum write speed)
- **100 MB/s*** = Maximum read speed (asterisk indicates "up to")
- **SD 4.xx spec** compliant (SD_SPEC4=1) - newer than most cards in catalog
- **CMD23 supported** - Set Block Count for multi-block operations
- Factory formatted with exFAT (not FAT32)
- Very recent manufacture (November 2024)
- Needs FAT32 reformat before use with P2 SD driver
- DATA_STAT_AFTER_ERASE=0 (erased data reads as 0s)
- **Benchmark data available** — see BENCHMARK-RESULTS.md for detailed throughput measurements (raw, multi-sector, and file-level)

### SPI Speed Characterization

**Test Date:** 2026-02-02
**Test Configuration:**
- SYSCLK: 200 MHz
- Phase 1: 1,000 single-sector reads (quick check)
- Phase 2: 10,000 single-sector reads (statistical confidence)
- Phase 3: 100 × 8-sector multi-block reads (800 sectors, sustained transfer)
- Total reads per speed level: 11,800 sector reads
- Test sectors: 1,000,000 to 1,010,000 (safe area away from FAT)
- CRC-16 verification on every read

**Results:**

| Target | Half Period | Actual | Delta | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Failure % |
|--------|-------------|--------|-------|---------|---------|---------|-----------|
| 18 MHz | 6 clocks | 16.6 MHz | -7.4% | 1,000 OK | 10,000 OK | 800 OK | **0.000%** |
| 20 MHz | 5 clocks | 20.0 MHz | +0.0% | 1,000 OK | 10,000 OK | 800 OK | **0.000%** |
| 22 MHz | 5 clocks | 20.0 MHz | -9.0% | 1,000 OK | 10,000 OK | 800 OK | **0.000%** |
| 25 MHz | 4 clocks | 25.0 MHz | +0.0% | 1,000 OK | 10,000 OK | 800 OK | **0.000%** |
| 27 MHz | 4 clocks | 25.0 MHz | -7.4% | timeout* | — | — | **100%** |

*At 27 MHz, CMD6 High Speed switch failed; card became unresponsive during Phase 1.

**Summary:**
- **Maximum Reliable Speed: 25 MHz** (47,200 total sector reads at 0% failure rate)
- CMD6 High Speed mode: Switch **failed** at 27 MHz, card became unresponsive

### Internal Throughput (measured at 25 MHz SPI)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Phase 2 Duration (10,000 reads) | 4.84 seconds |
| Throughput | **1,059 KB/s** |
| Sectors/second | 2,068 |
| Latency per sector | 0.48 ms |

**Performance Class:** HIGH - **Fastest card tested** (12% faster than Gigastone Camera Plus, 35% faster than Samsung/SanDisk).
