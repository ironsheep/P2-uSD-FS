### Notes

- **Gigastone-branded** card using shared OEM silicon (MID $9F)
- MID $9F + OID "TI" = common across Amazon, Kingston, Kodak, Micro Center, Silicon Power
- Likely a large contract manufacturer supplying multiple brands
- **"High Endurance"** product line for continuous recording (dashcams, security cameras)
- **MLC** (Multi-Level Cell) flash - more durable than TLC for write-intensive applications
- **10x** = marketing claim for endurance vs standard cards
- **HC I** = SDHC UHS-I interface
- **U1** = UHS Speed Class 1 (10 MB/s minimum write)
- Product name "00000" and revision "0.0" = OEM/white-label product
- Currently formatted with P2FMTER and used as primary development card
- Third different silicon source found in Gigastone cards
