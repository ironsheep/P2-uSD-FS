### SPI Speed Characterization

**Test Date:** 2026-02-02
**Test Configuration:**
- SYSCLK: 200 MHz
- Phase 1: 1,000 single-sector reads (quick check)
- Phase 2: 10,000 single-sector reads (statistical confidence)
- Phase 3: 100 × 8-sector multi-block reads (800 sectors, sustained transfer)
- Total reads per speed level: 11,800 sector reads
- Test sectors: 1,000,000 to 1,010,000 (safe area away from FAT)
- CRC-16 verification on every read

**Results:**

| Target | Half Period | Actual | Delta | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Failure % |
|--------|-------------|--------|-------|---------|---------|---------|-----------|
| 18 MHz | 6 clocks | 16.6 MHz | -7.4% | 1,000 OK | 10,000 OK | 800 OK | **0.000%** |
| 20 MHz | 5 clocks | 20.0 MHz | +0.0% | 1,000 OK | 10,000 OK | 800 OK | **0.000%** |
| 22 MHz | 5 clocks | 20.0 MHz | -9.0% | 1,000 OK | 10,000 OK | 800 OK | **0.000%** |
| 25 MHz | 4 clocks | 25.0 MHz | +0.0% | 1,000 OK | 10,000 OK | 800 OK | **0.000%** |
| 27 MHz | 4 clocks | 25.0 MHz | -7.4% | timeout* | — | — | **100%** |

*At 27 MHz, CMD6 High Speed switch failed; card became unresponsive during Phase 1.

**Summary:**
- **Maximum Reliable Speed: 25 MHz** (47,200 total sector reads at 0% failure rate)
- CMD6 High Speed mode: Switch **failed** at 27 MHz, card became unresponsive

### Internal Throughput (measured at 25 MHz SPI)

| Metric | Value |

#### Sysclk Effect (320 vs 270 MHz)

| Test | 320 MHz (KB/s) | 270 MHz (KB/s) | Delta |
|------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Raw Read 1x512B | 942 | 801 | -15.0% |
| Raw Read 64x (32 KB) | 1,950 | 1,834 | -5.9% |
| Raw Write 64x (32 KB) | 1,969 | 1,867 | -5.2% |
| File Read 256 KB | 1,029 | 981 | -4.7% |
| File Write 32 KB | 367 | 274 | -25.3% |

The raw multi-sector operations show the typical ~5% sysclk effect. However, file-level writes at 270 MHz show dramatic variance (Max=52,016 us for 512B, Max=134,450 us for 32 KB), with the card controller introducing unpredictable write stalls. This inflates the average and reduces reported throughput well beyond the expected sysclk effect. Raw multi-sector writes (which bypass FAT) are not affected, confirming the stalls occur during FAT metadata writes.
