### Notes

- **MID $C9** - Not in standard manufacturer ID table; suspected **BIWIN** (Chinese OEM that manufactures Lexar-branded cards under license from Longsys)
- **Same product family** as Lexar 64GB (lexar-mssd0-64gb.md): identical PNM "MSSD0", PRV 6.1, CCC $DB7, SCR bytes 0-3
- **Different MID**: $C9 vs $AD (Longsys/Lexar) - different fab or updated MID assignment
- **Different OID**: "M`" ($4D $60) vs "LS" ($4C $53) - supports different manufacturer theory
- **CCC $DB7** includes Class 1 (stream read) and Class 11 (video speed class) - video-optimized card
- **SD 4.xx spec** compliant (SD_SPEC4=1)
- **CMD_SUPPORT $00** - neither CMD20 nor CMD23 (unlike the 64GB Lexar which had both)
- Factory formatted with exFAT (not FAT32)
- Very recent manufacture (April 2025)
- Needs FAT32 reformat before use with P2 SD driver
- DATA_STAT_AFTER_ERASE=0 (erased data reads as 0s)

### SPI Speed Characterization

**Test Date:** 2026-02-14
**Test Configuration:**
- SYSCLK: 200 MHz
- Phase 1: 1,000 single-sector reads (quick check)
- Phase 2: 10,000 single-sector reads (statistical confidence)
- Phase 3: 100 x 8-sector multi-block reads (800 sectors, sustained transfer)
- Total reads per speed level: 11,800 sector reads
- Test sectors: 1,000,000 to 1,010,000 (safe area away from FAT)
- CRC-16 verification on every read

**Results:**

| Target | Half Period | Actual | Delta | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Failure % |
|--------|-------------|--------|-------|---------|---------|---------|-----------|
| 18 MHz | 6 clocks | 16.6 MHz | -7.4% | 1,000 OK | 10,000 OK | 800 OK | **0.000%** |
| 20 MHz | 5 clocks | 20.0 MHz | +0.0% | 1,000 OK | 10,000 OK | 800 OK | **0.000%** |
| 22 MHz | 5 clocks | 20.0 MHz | -9.0% | 1,000 OK | 10,000 OK | 800 OK | **0.000%** |
| 25 MHz | 4 clocks | 25.0 MHz | +0.0% | 1,000 OK | 10,000 OK | 800 OK | **0.000%** |
| 27 MHz | 4 clocks | 25.0 MHz | -7.4% | timeout* | -- | -- | **100%** |

*At 27 MHz, CMD6 High Speed switch failed; card became unresponsive during Phase 1.

**Summary:**
- **Maximum Reliable Speed: 25 MHz** (47,200 total sector reads at 0% failure rate)
- CMD6 High Speed mode: Switch **failed** at 27 MHz, card became unresponsive
- Identical behavior to Lexar 64GB sibling and all other cards tested

### Internal Throughput (measured at 25 MHz SPI)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Phase 2 Duration (10,000 reads) | 4.28 seconds |
| Throughput | **1,196 KB/s** |
| Sectors/second | 2,335 |
| Latency per sector | 0.43 ms |

**Performance Class:** HIGH - **Fastest card tested** (13% faster than Lexar 64GB at 1,059 KB/s, 27% faster than Gigastone Camera Plus at 944 KB/s).

#### Sysclk Effect (350 vs 250 MHz)

| Test | 350 MHz (KB/s) | 250 MHz (KB/s) | Delta |
|------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| **Raw Single-Sector** | | | |
| Read 1x512B | 819 | 745 | +9.9% |
| Write 1x512B | 680 | 623 | +9.2% |
| **Raw Multi-Sector** | | | |
| Read 64 (32 KB) | 2,420 | 2,233 | +8.4% |
| Write 64 (32 KB) | 2,275 | 2,082 | +9.3% |
| **File-Level** | | | |
| File Write 512B | 102 | 80 | +27.5% |
| File Write 4 KB | 392 | 334 | +17.4% |
| File Write 32 KB | 616 | 551 | +11.8% |
| File Read 4 KB | 1,369 | 1,186 | +15.4% |
| File Read 32 KB | 1,455 | 1,264 | +15.1% |
| File Read 128 KB | 1,444 | 1,258 | +14.8% |
| File Read 256 KB | 1,444 | 1,256 | +15.0% |

Both speeds produce exactly 25,000 kHz SPI clock. The **8-10% raw sector improvement** at 350 MHz reflects reduced Spin2 overhead between streamer operations. The **15% file-level read improvement** reflects FAT traversal and buffer management overhead. File-level writes show **12-28% improvement** — the smaller the transfer, the more overhead-dominated and sysclk-sensitive it becomes.

#### Cross-Card Comparison: Blue 128GB vs Red 64GB (both at 350 MHz / 25 MHz SPI)

Both cards tested at identical conditions: 350 MHz sysclk, 25,000 kHz SPI — true apples-to-apples comparison.

| Test | Blue 128GB (KB/s) | Red 64GB (KB/s) | Delta | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|-------|
| **Raw Single-Sector** | | | | |
| Read 1x512B | 831 | 1,239 | -33% | 64GB has much lower latency |
| Write 1x512B | 673 | 677 | 0% | Identical |
| **Raw Multi-Sector** | | | | |
| Read 64 sectors (32 KB) | 2,423 | 2,379 | +2% | Nearly identical at bulk |
| Write 64 sectors (32 KB) | 2,272 | 2,248 | +1% | Nearly identical at bulk |
| **File-Level** | | | | |
| File Write 32 KB | 604 | 469 | +29% | 128GB significantly faster |
| File Read 4 KB | 1,370 | 1,301 | +5% | |
| File Read 256 KB | 1,444 | 1,531 | -6% | 64GB slightly faster |
| **Overhead** | | | | |
| Mount | 232.7 ms | 358.0 ms | -35% | 128GB mounts faster |
| File Open | 127 us | 149 us | -15% | 128GB opens faster |

**Key observations:**
- **Single-sector read latency**: 64GB is 33% faster (413 vs 616 us avg). The 128GB has higher first-read variance (Max=2,486 us), suggesting longer internal access time for its larger flash array.
- **Bulk transfer**: At the same SPI speed, both cards deliver nearly identical multi-sector throughput (~2,380 KB/s read, ~2,260 KB/s write). The SPI bus is the bottleneck, not the flash.
- **File-level writes**: 128GB is 29% faster at 32 KB writes — likely better flash controller parallelism or larger write buffers in the larger card.
- **File-level reads at 256 KB**: 64GB is 6% faster, possibly due to its faster single-sector access benefiting the FAT lookup overhead between clusters.
- **Same product family**: Both are Lexar MSSD0 PRV 6.1 with identical CCC, CSD timing, and SCR capabilities. The 128GB uses a different MID ($C9 vs $AD) and OID ("M`" vs "LS"), suggesting a different fab or OEM partner.

### Regression Test Results

| Raw Sector (14 tests) | **14/14 PASS** | **14/14 PASS** | |
