### Notes

- **PNY-branded** card using **Phison** controller silicon (MID $27)
- MID $27 + OID "PH" = Phison controller family (also used by Delkin, HP, Kingston, Lexar older, PNY)
- **driver handles this card correctly** - MID $27 detected, SPI clock limited to 20 MHz
- **HC I** = SDHC UHS-I interface
- Older card (manufactured August 2018)
- CMD20 (Speed Class) supported per SCR CMD_SUPPORT field
- 8 KB clusters (smaller than typical 32 KB) due to P2FMTER formatting
- driver fixes resolved previous V2 unmount hang issue
- **File open latency:** 177 us avg on empty directory (after format) — previously measured at 16.9 ms when directory contained many files, showing directory size strongly affects open time
- **Benchmark data available** — see Benchmark Results section below for detailed throughput measurements; multi-sector reads competitive (2,376 KB/s at 64 sectors) despite slow single-sector write performance

### SPI Speed Characterization

**Test Date:** 2026-02-02
**Test Configuration:**
- SYSCLK: 200 MHz
- Phase 1: 1,000 single-sector reads (quick check)
- Phase 2: 10,000 single-sector reads (statistical confidence)
- Phase 3: 100 x 8-sector multi-block reads (800 sectors, sustained transfer)
- Total reads per speed level: 11,800 sector reads
- Test sectors: 1,000,000 to 1,010,000 (safe area away from FAT)
- CRC-16 verification on every read

**Results:**

| Target | Half Period | Actual | Delta | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Failure % |
|--------|-------------|--------|-------|---------|---------|---------|-----------|
| 18 MHz | 6 clocks | 16.6 MHz | -7.4% | 1,000 OK | 10,000 OK | 800 OK | **0.000%** |
| 20 MHz | 5 clocks | 20.0 MHz | +0.0% | 1,000 OK | 10,000 OK | 800 OK | **0.000%** |
| 22 MHz | 5 clocks | 20.0 MHz | -9.0% | 1,000 OK | 10,000 OK | 800 OK | **0.000%** |
| 25 MHz | 4 clocks | 25.0 MHz | +0.0% | 1,000 OK | 10,000 OK | 800 OK | **0.000%** |
| 27 MHz | 4 clocks | 25.0 MHz | -7.4% | 0 OK, 1,000 timeout | — | — | **100%** |

**Summary:**
- **Maximum Reliable Speed: 25 MHz** (47,200 total sector reads at 0% failure rate)
- **25 MHz PASSED all phases** - 11,800 reads with 0 CRC errors, 0 timeouts
- CMD6 High Speed mode: Switch **failed** at 27 MHz, card became unresponsive (same behavior as SanDisk)
- Card has significantly slower internal processing than SanDisk cards (~20x slower throughput)

**Key Finding:** The 20 MHz limit for Phison/PNY cards is **overly conservative**. This card successfully ran at 25 MHz with **0 CRC errors across 47,200 reads** (4 speed levels x 11,800 reads each). The TRAN_SPEED register ($32 = 25 MHz) accurately reflects this card's capability.

**Recommendation:** The driver's MID $27 -> 20 MHz limit should be reconsidered. This PNY/Phison card handles 25 MHz reliably. The failure mode at 27 MHz (after CMD6 switch attempt) is identical to SanDisk cards - the CMD6 High Speed switch fails and the card becomes unresponsive, not a gradual degradation from clock speed.

### Internal Throughput (measured at 25 MHz SPI)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Phase 2 Duration (10,000 reads) | 160.1 seconds |
| Throughput | **31.3 KB/s** |
| Sectors/second | 62.5 |
| Latency per sector | 16.0 ms |

**Performance Class:** LOW - Slow internal controller (~25x slower than high-performance cards). SPI clock speed is not the bottleneck; internal flash/controller latency dominates.

#### Sysclk Effect (350 vs 250 MHz)

| Test | 350 MHz (KB/s) | 250 MHz (KB/s) | Delta |
|------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Raw Read 1x512B | 734 | 677 | -7.8% |
| Raw Read 64x (32 KB) | 2,376 | 2,194 | -7.7% |

The PNY Phison controller shows distinctive behavior:
- **File open: 177 us avg** on empty directory (clean format). Previously measured at 16.9 ms with many files — directory scan dominates open time on this controller.
- **Raw single-sector write: 50 KB/s** with enormous variance (Min=2,936, Max=14,654 us) — the Phison controller has unpredictable write commit latency.
- **Multi-sector reads competitive**: 2,376 KB/s at 64 sectors at 350 MHz — good sequential read throughput.
- **Multi-sector writes slow**: 1,037 KB/s at 64 sectors — roughly half of high-performance cards, indicating the write bottleneck is in the flash controller, not the SPI interface.
- **Extremely consistent reads**: Min≈Max for single-sector (697 us) and multi-sector reads — zero variance, suggesting the Phison controller has deterministic read paths.
- **Sysclk effect ~7-8% on reads** — higher than write-dominated tests (3-4%), consistent with Spin2 inter-sector overhead scaling with clock speed.
